Preclinical studies suggest that bortezomib has synergistic activity with rituximab, which provides a rationale for the exploration of treatment combinations.\nMETHODS: The activity and safety of bortezomib in combination with rituximab and dexamethasone were investigated in patients with relapsed or chemotherapy-refractory mantle cell lymphoma. A treatment cycle consisted of bortezomib (1.3 mg/m\u00b2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11; six 21-day cycles), rituximab (375 mg/m\u00b2, day 1) and dexamethasone (40 mg orally, days 1 to 4). Responding patients received four consolidating doses of rituximab. Sixteen patients with progressive mantle cell lymphoma after a median of three prior lines of therapy were enrolled.\nRESULTS: The overall response rate was 81.3% (13 patients), with seven patients achieving a complete response (43.8%). Six of these patients were also negative for disease activity by positron emission tomography scanning. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 12.1 and 38.6 months, respectively. In patients achieving a complete response, the median progression-free survival and overall survival have not yet been reached.

While their effects on fibrinolysis have been characterized in vitro, little is known about their activity in vivo with respect to plasminogen activation and blood clot clearance.\nRESULTS: To select a potent SMTP congener for the evaluation of its action in vitro and in vivo, we tested several SMTP congeners with distinct structural properties for their effects on plasminogen activation. As a result, SMTP-7 (orniplabin) was found to have distinguished activity. Several lines of biochemical evidence supported the idea that SMTP-7 acted as a plasminogen modulator. SMTP-7 elevated plasma level of plasmin-\u03b12-antiplasmin complex, an index of plasmin formation in vivo, 1.5-fold in mice after the intravenous injections at doses of 5 and 10 mg kg-1. In a rat pulmonary embolism model, SMTP-7 (5 mg kg-1) enhanced the rate of clot clearance ~3-fold in the absence of exogenous plasminogen activator.

Because the DBT detector panel is typically stationary during the source rotation, antiscatter grids are not generally compatible with DBT; thus, a software-based scatter correction is required. This work proposes a fully iterative scatter correction method that uses a novel fast Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) with a tissue-composition ratio estimation technique for DBT imaging.\nMETHODS: To apply MCS to scatter estimation, the material composition in each voxel should be known. To overcome the lack of prior accurate knowledge of tissue composition for DBT, a tissue-composition ratio is estimated based on the observation that the breast tissues are principally composed of adipose and glandular tissues. Using this approximation, the composition ratio can be estimated from the reconstructed attenuation coefficients, and the scatter distribution can then be estimated by MCS using the composition ratio. The scatter estimation and image reconstruction procedures can be performed iteratively until an acceptable accuracy is achieved. For practical use, (i) the authors have implemented a fast MCS using a graphics processing unit (GPU), (ii) the MCS is simplified to transport only x-rays in the energy range of 10-50 keV, modeling Rayleigh and Compton scattering and the photoelectric effect using the tissue-composition ratio of adipose and glandular tissues, and (iii) downsampling is used because the scatter distribution varies rather smoothly.\nRESULTS: The authors have demonstrated that the proposed method can accurately estimate the scatter distribution, and that the contrast-to-noise ratio of the final reconstructed image is significantly improved. The authors validated the performance of the MCS by changing the tissue thickness, composition ratio, and x-ray energy. The authors confirmed that the tissue-composition ratio estimation was quite accurate under a variety of conditions. Our GPU-based fast MCS implementation took approximately 3 s to generate each angular projection for a 6 cm thick breast, which is believed to make this process acceptable for clinical applications. In addition, the clinical preferences of three radiologists were evaluated; the preference for the proposed method compared to the preference for the convolution-based method was statistically meaningful (p < 0.05, McNemar test).\nQuestion: Do fully iterative scatter corrected digital breast tomosynthesis using GPU-based fast Monte Carlo simulation and composition ratio update?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

It is linked to many physiological functions in human cells including stress response, protein degradation, organelle turnover, caspase-independent cell death and tumor suppression. Malignant transformation is frequently associated with deregulation of autophagy and several tumor suppressors can modulate autophagic processes. The tumor suppressor p53 can induce autophagy after metabolic or genotoxic stress through transcriptionally-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In this study we expand on the former mechanism by functionally characterizing a p53 family target gene, ISG20L1 under conditions of genotoxic stress.\nRESULTS: We identified a p53 target gene, ISG20L1, and show that transcription of the gene can be regulated by all three p53 family members (p53, p63, and p73). We generated an antibody to ISG20L1 and found that it localizes to the nucleolar and perinucleolar regions of the nucleus and its protein levels increase in a p53- and p73-dependent manner after various forms of genotoxic stress. When ectopically expressed in epithelial cancer-derived cell lines, ISG20L1 expression decreased clonogenic survival without a concomitant elevation in apoptosis and this effect was partially rescued in cells that were ATG5 deficient. Knockdown of ISG20L1 did not alter 5-FU induced apoptosis as assessed by PARP and caspase-3 cleavage, sub-G1 content, and DNA laddering. Thus, we investigated the role of ISG20L1 in autophagy, a process commonly associated with type II cell death, and found that ISG20L1 knockdown decreased levels of autophagic vacuoles and LC3-II after genotoxic stress as assessed by electron microscopy, biochemical, and immunohistochemical measurements of LC3-II.\nQuestion: Is iSG20L1 a p53 family target gene that modulates genotoxic stress-induced autophagy?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

This relationship remained with further adjustment for retinal arteriolar calibre and presence of retinopathy (OR 1.64; 95% CI 1.19-2.27), and after excluding participants with retinopathy (OR 1.60; 95% CI 1.16-2.21). Retinal D (f) was not related to impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose (OR 1.19; 95% CI 0.85-1.67).\nQuestion: Is retinal fractal dimension increased in persons with diabetes but not impaired glucose metabolism : the Australian Diabetes , Obesity and Lifestyle ( AusDiab ) study?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

In Europe, the invasive signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus is excluding the native white clawed crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes.\nRESULTS: This study compared the predatory functional responses and prey choice of native and invasive crayfish and measured impacts of parasitism on the predatory strength of the native species. Invasive crayfish showed a higher (>10%) prey (Gammarus pulex) intake rate than (size matched) natives, reflecting a shorter (16%) prey handling time. The native crayfish also showed greater selection for crustacean prey over molluscs and bloodworm, whereas the invasive species was a more generalist predator. A. pallipes parasitised by the microsporidian parasite Thelohania contejeani showed a 30% reduction in prey intake. We suggest that this results from parasite-induced muscle damage, and this is supported by a reduced (38%) attack rate and increased (30%) prey handling time.\nQuestion: Do predatory functional response and prey choice identify predation differences between native/invasive and parasitised/unparasitised crayfish?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

Understanding the biology of this parasite is vital in identifying potential novel drug targets. During every 48-hour intra-erythrocytic asexual replication cycle, a single parasite can produce up to 32 progeny. This extensive proliferation implies that parasites require substantial amounts of lipid precursors for membrane biogenesis. Glycerol kinase is a highly conserved enzyme that functions at the interface of lipid synthesis and carbohydrate metabolism. P. falciparum glycerol kinase catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of glycerol to glycerol-3-phosphate, a major phospholipid precursor.\nMETHODS: The P. falciparum glycerol kinase gene was disrupted using double crossover homologous DNA recombination to generate a knockout parasite line. Southern hybridization and mRNA analysis were used to verify gene disruption. Parasite growth rates were monitored by flow cytometry. Radiolabelling studies were used to assess incorporation of glycerol into parasite phospholipids.\nRESULTS: Disruption of the P. falciparum glycerol kinase gene produced viable parasites, but their growth was significantly reduced to 56.5\u00b11.8% when compared to wild type parasites.

We previously reported phasic changes in action potential frequency in the dorsomedial and dorsolateral striatum after cues that signaled alcohol availability, prompting approach behavior.\nMETHODS: We investigated the hypothesis that dopamine transmission modulates these phasic firing changes.

Infiltrating neutrophils constitute the first line of defense that precedes a second wave of emigrating monocytes reinforcing the inflammatory reaction. The mechanisms initiating this sequential process remained largely obscure.\nRESULTS: Using advanced in vivo microscopy and in vitro/ex vivo techniques, we identified individual spatiotemporal expression patterns of selectins and their principal interaction partners on neutrophils, resident/inflammatory monocytes, and endothelial cells. Coordinating the intraluminal trafficking of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes to common sites of extravasation, selectins assign different sites to these immune cells for their initial interactions with the microvascular endothelium. Whereas constitutively expressed leukocyte L-selectin/CD62L and endothelial P-selectin/CD62P together with CD44 and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1/CD162 initiate the emigration of neutrophils, de novo synthesis of endothelial E-selectin/CD62E launches the delayed secondary recruitment of inflammatory monocytes. In this context, P-selectin/CD62P and L-selectin/CD62L together with P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1/CD162 and CD44 were found to regulate the flux of rolling neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes, whereas E-selectin/CD62E selectively adjusts the rolling velocity of inflammatory monocytes.

Additionally the authors investigated whether their mathematical model could predict the two known types of periodontitis, aggressive (AgP) and chronic periodontitis (CP).\nMETHODS: The time evolution of periodontitis was modeled by an iterative function, based on the hypothesis that the host immune response level determines the rate of periodontitis progression. The chaotic properties of this function were investigated by direct iteration, and the model was validated by immunologic and clinical parameters derived from two clinical study populations.\nRESULTS: Periodontitis can be described as chaos with the level of the host immune response determining its progression rate; the dynamics of the proposed model suggest that by increasing the host immune response level, periodontitis progression rate decreases.

This study examined adolescents' health beliefs and how they relate to intentions to seek physician care across different types of health problems.\nMETHODS: Two hundred ten high school students (54% females; 76.6% participation rate) completed a self-administered survey of four separate age- and gender-specific health case scenarios: an adolescent who has symptoms of pneumonia; smokes five cigarettes daily; plans to initiate sex; and has symptoms of depression. For each health scenario, participants rated the seriousness of the health problem, physician effectiveness, and intentions to seek physician care.\nRESULTS: Most adolescents believed all health problems were serious except for planning to initiate sex (P < 0.001). Adolescents believed that physicians were most effective in diagnosis and treatment for pneumonia, followed by cigarette use, depression, and sex, respectively (P's < 0.001). Adolescents' intentions to seek physician care were greatest for physical as compared to risk behavior or mental health problems (P < 0.001). Multiple regression analyses revealed that adolescents had greater intentions to seek physician care for cigarette, sex, and depression when they believed physicians were effective and they perceived these as health problems after controlling for age and gender (all P's < 0.001).

The results were correlated to clinical data.\nRESULTS: Liver and kidney grafts both exhibited an upregulation of the leukocyte-recruiting chemokines CCL2, CCL3, and CCL4. Notably, liver grafts strongly upregulated CCL20, a dendritic cell, and T-cell recruiting chemokine. By comparing the gene expression in liver grafts with the clinical outcome, we found that 14 of 45 investigated inflammatory genes were expressed significantly higher in patients without early rejection when compared with those with early rejections.

We investigated the effect of SM22 deficiency in a mouse artery injury model to determine the role of SM22 in arterial chondrogenesis.\nRESULTS: Sm22 knockout (Sm22(-/-)) mice developed prominent medial chondrogenesis 2 weeks after carotid denudation as evidenced by the enhanced expression of chondrogenic markers including type II collagen, aggrecan, osteopontin, bone morphogenetic protein 2, and SRY-box containing gene 9 (SOX9). This was concomitant with suppression of VSMC key transcription factor myocardin and of VSMC markers such as SM \u03b1-actin and myosin heavy chain. The conversion tendency from myogenesis to chondrogenesis was also observed in primary Sm22(-/-) VSMCs and in a VSMC line after Sm22 knockdown: SM22 deficiency altered VSMC morphology with compromised stress fibre formation and increased actin dynamics. Meanwhile, the expression level of Sox9 mRNA was up-regulated while the mRNA levels of myocardin and VSMC markers were down-regulated, indicating a pro-chondrogenic transcriptional switch in SM22-deficient VSMCs.

Mature, Ag-loaded DC were used as APC for leukemia-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) induction and demonstrated cytotoxic activity against leukemic targets.

Transient over expression of the tumor suppressor gene APC in colon cancer cells prevents entry into S phase of the cell cycle, a phenotype only partially restored by cotransfection of a transcriptionally active form of beta-catenin. In an attempt to define its transcription-independent tumor suppressor functions, we tested whether APC directly affects DNA replication.\nMETHODS: A transcriptionally quiescent in vitro DNA replication system, the polymerase chain reaction, DNA binding assays, and transient transfections in colon cancer cell lines were used to determine the effects of APC on DNA replication and the mechanism by which it works.\nRESULTS: We report that exogenous full-length APC inhibits replication of template DNA through a function that maps to amino acids 2140-2421, a region of the protein commonly lost by somatic or germline mutation. This segment of APC directly interacts with DNA, while mutation of the DNA-binding S(T)PXX motifs within it abolishes DNA binding and reduces inhibition of DNA replication. Phosphorylation of this segment by cyclin-dependent kinases also reduces inhibition of DNA replication.

Similarly, TNFalpha, IFN gamma or salmeterol treatment augmented bradykinin induced IPx responses (127.4 +/- 8.3, 128.0 +/- 8.4 and 111.7 +/- 5.0%, P < 0.05). No treatment significantly influenced sodium fluoride induced IPx responses suggesting regulation occurs at the receptor locus. Analyses of mRNA expression of components of the IPx pathway i.e. H1 Histamine Receptor (HRH1), B2 Bradykinin Receptor (BDKRB2), G alpha q/11 and PLC-beta1 identified that a significant induction of receptor mRNA (>2 fold) was a feature of these responses explaining the cytokine and spasmogen specificity. The HRH1 and BDKRB2 promoter regions were mapped in ASM and promoter-reporter analyses identified that salmeterol can induce HRH1 (>2 fold) and BDKRB2 (2-5 fold) transcription. The effect of cytokines on HRH1 and BDKRB2 promoter-reporter expression suggested a more complex regulation of mRNA expression involving additional loci to the core promoter.\nQuestion: Do salmeterol and cytokines modulate inositol-phosphate signalling in human airway smooth muscle cells via regulation at the receptor locus?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

Levels of anxiety and depression were assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A and HADS-D, respectively). Self-reported information on various work-related factors, demographics, lifestyle and somatic health problems was included. The main analytical methods were univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA)/Kruskal-Wallis test, chi(2)/Fisher's exact test and logistic regression.\nRESULTS: Compared with non-farmers, farmers had higher levels and prevalences of depression, particularly the male farmers, who also had higher anxiety levels. Among men, farmers reported longer work hours, lower income, higher psychological job demands and less decision latitude compared with non-farmers. Farmers had physically heavier work and a lower level of education than non-farmers. Generally, the differences were largest between full-time farmers and non-farmers.

Furthermore, it has not been tested whether aging and alcohol interact to modify this epigenetic phenomenon, thereby having an independent effect on gene expression.\nMETHODS: Old (18\u00a0months) and young (4\u00a0months) male C57BL/6 mice were pair-fed either a Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet with alcohol (18% of energy) or an isocaloric Lieber-DeCarli control diet for 5\u00a0weeks. Global DNA hydroxymethylation and DNA methylation were analyzed from hepatic DNA using a new liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Hepatic mRNA expression of the Tet enzymes were measured via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.\nRESULTS: In young mice, mild chronic alcohol exposure significantly reduced global DNA hydroxymethylation compared with control mice (0.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 vs. 0.29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004).

Analysis of serum autoantibodies to tumor antigens combined with gene expression profiling of primary tumors may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying lung carcinogenesis and identify new AD biomarkers.\nMETHODS: T7 phage cDNA libraries were used to identify AZGP1 autoantibodies in the serum of 473 patients (192 ADs, 192 matched controls, and 89 additional ADs for confirmation of findings). AZGP1 mRNA expression was examined in 86 ADs and 10 control lung tissue samples using oligonucleotide microarrays. AZGP1 protein expression was studied in 230 tissue samples (222 ADs; 8 controls) with immunohistochemistry. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to correlate circulating autoantibody and tissue mRNA production with survival.

Sixty-four patients with ICH and intraventricular hemorrhage who were treated with IVF were compared with 64 controls, who did not receive IVF, matched for ICH volume. The course of PHE was assessed on computed tomography scans (day 1, days 2 and 3, days 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12) using a threshold-based semiautomatic volumetric algorithm. Relative PHE was calculated as a ratio of PHE volume and initial ICH volume.\nRESULTS: The matching algorithm resulted in similar mean ICH volumes in both groups (20.01 \u00b1 17.5 mL, IVF vs 20.08 \u00b1 17.1 mL, control). Intraventricular hemorrhage volume was larger in the IVF group (26.8 \u00b1 19.2 mL vs 9.2 \u00b1 13.4 mL). The mean total rtPA dose used for IVF was 8 \u00b1 6 mg.

Whereas MAPK is a well-known effector pathway of KRAS, blocking this pathway with clinically available MAPK inhibitors is relatively ineffective. Here, we report that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition rewires the expression of receptor tyrosine kinases, leading to differential feedback activation of the MAPK pathway following MEK inhibition. In epithelial-like KRAS-mutant lung cancers, this feedback was attributed to ERBB3-mediated activation of MEK and AKT. In contrast, in mesenchymal-like KRAS-mutant lung cancers, FGFR1 was dominantly expressed but suppressed by the negative regulator Sprouty proteins; MEK inhibition led to repression of SPRY4 and subsequent FGFR1-mediated reactivation of MEK and AKT. Therapeutically, the combination of a MEK inhibitor (MEKi) and an FGFR inhibitor (FGFRi) induced cell death in vitro and tumor regressions in vivo These data establish the rationale and a therapeutic approach to treat mesenchymal-like KRAS-mutant lung cancers effectively with clinically available FGFR1 and MAPK inhibitors.\nQuestion: Does epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition define Feedback Activation of Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Signaling Induced by MEK Inhibition in KRAS-Mutant Lung Cancer?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

A variety of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria produce large quantities of indole that functions as an intercellular signal controlling diverse aspects of bacterial physiology.\nRESULTS: In this study, we sought a novel role of indole in a gram-positive bacteria Paenibacillus alvei that can produce extracellular indole at a concentration of up to 300 \u03bcM in the stationary phase in Luria-Bertani medium. Unlike previous studies, our data show that the production of indole in P. alvei is strictly controlled by catabolite repression since the addition of glucose and glycerol completely turns off the indole production. The addition of exogenous indole markedly inhibits the heat resistance of P. alvei without affecting cell growth. Observation of cell morphology with electron microscopy shows that indole inhibits the development of spore coats and cortex in P. alvei. As a result of the immature spore formation of P. alvei, indole also decreases P. alvei survival when exposed to antibiotics, low pH, and ethanol. Additionally, indole derivatives also influence the heat resistance; for example, a plant auxin, 3-indolylacetonitrile dramatically (2900-fold) decreased the heat resistance of P. alvei, while another auxin 3-indoleacetic acid had a less significant influence on the heat resistance of P. alvei.\nQuestion: Do indole and 3-indolylacetonitrile inhibit spore maturation in Paenibacillus alvei?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

The effects of BA on the phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB and on kinases in the MAPK signalling pathway were determined. The anti-HCV activity of BA in combination with other HCV inhibitors was also determined to assess its use as an anti-HCV supplement.\nRESULTS: BA inhibited HCV replication in both Ava5 replicon cells and in a cell culture-derived infectious HCV particle system. Treatment with a combination of BA and IFN-\u03b1, the protease inhibitor telaprevir or the NS5B polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir resulted in the synergistic suppression of HCV RNA replication. Exogenous overexpression of COX-2 gradually attenuated the inhibitory effect of BA on HCV replication, suggesting that BA reduces HCV replication by suppressing the expression of COX-2. In particular, BA down-regulated HCV-induced COX-2 expression by reducing the phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB and ERK1/2 of the MAPK signalling pathway.\nQuestion: Does betulinic acid exert anti-hepatitis C virus activity via the suppression of NF-\u03baB- and MAPK-ERK1/2-mediated COX-2 expression?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of miR-155 drives an increased mutation frequency both in vitro and in vivo, promoting genomic instability by affecting multiple DNA repair pathways. miR-155 overexpression causes a decrease in homologous recombination, but yields a concurrent increase in the error-prone nonhomologous end-joining pathway. Despite repressing established targets MLH1 and MSH6, the identified mutation pattern upon miR-155 overexpression does not resemble that of a mismatch repair-deficient background. Further investigation revealed that all four subunits of polymerase delta, a high-fidelity DNA replication, and repair polymerase are downregulated at the mRNA level in the context of miR-155 overexpression. FOXO3a, a transcription factor and known target of miR-155, has one or more putative binding site(s) in the promoter of all four polymerase delta subunits. Finally, suppression of FOXO3a by miR-155 or by siRNA knockdown is sufficient to repress the expression of the catalytic subunit of polymerase delta, POLD1, at the protein level, indicating that FOXO3a contributes to the regulation of polymerase delta levels.\nQuestion: Does miR-155 Overexpression promote Genomic Instability by Reducing High-fidelity Polymerase Delta Expression and Activating Error-Prone DSB Repair?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

We hypothesized that GM-CSF and surfactant protein D (SP-D) would enhance the clearance of proteins and dying cells that are typically present in the airways of PAP lungs.\nMETHODS: Cells and cell-free supernatant of therapeutic bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of a two-year-old patient with LPI were isolated on multiple occasions. Diagnostic BALF samples from an age-matched patient with bronchitis or adult PAP patients were used as controls. SP-D and total protein content of the supernatants were determined by BCA assays and Western blots, respectively. Cholesterol content was determined by a calorimetic assay or Oil Red O staining of cytospin preparations. The cells and surfactant lipids were also analyzed by transmission electron microscopy.

This study focuses on the role of human tumor cells in governing the differentiation of mouse mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to pericytes and their recruitment in the tumor angiogenesis process.\nRESULTS: We show that C3H/10T1/2 mouse embryonic mesenchymal stem cells, under the influence of different tumor cell-derived conditioned media, differentiate into mature pericytes.

Routine laboratory tests were performed and ADMA was determined. Patients were followed for a primary endpoint of in hospital death and complicated outcome.\nRESULTS: ADMA levels were highest in patients with a cancer-related diagnosis (0.76 (0.63-0.93) micromol/L) and in patients with a cardiovascular diagnosis (0.69 (0.60-0.80) micromol/L; p<0.001).

Overactivation of NICD (Notch1 intracellular domain) at early embryonic stages leads to ectopic HC formation. However, it remains unclear whether such an effect can be elicited at later embryonic or postnatal stages, which has important implications in mouse HC regeneration by reactivation of Notch1 signaling.\nRESULTS: We performed comprehensive in vivo inducible overactivation of NICD at various developmental stages. In CAG(CreER+); Rosa26-NICD(loxp/+) mice, tamoxifen treatment at embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) generated ectopic HCs in the non-sensory regions in both utricle and cochlea, whereas ectopic HCs only appeared in the utricle when tamoxifen was given at E13. When tamoxifen was injected at postnatal day 0 (P0) and P1, no ectopic HCs were observed in either utricle or cochlea. Interestingly, Notch1 signaling induced new HCs in a non-cell-autonomous manner, because the new HCs did not express NICD.

GKN1 is downregulated in Helicobacter pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells and loss of GKN1 expression is closely associated with gastric carcinogenesis, but underlying mechanisms of the tumor-suppressing effects of GKN1 remain largely unknown.\nMETHODS: AGS, MKN1, MKN28 gastric cancer cells and HFE-145 immortalized non-neoplastic gastric mucosal cells were transfected with GKN1 or shGKN1. We conducted molecular and functional studies of GKN1 and miR-185 and investigated the mechanisms of alteration. We also analyzed epigenetic alterations in 80 gastric cancer tissues.\nRESULTS: Restoration of GKN1 protein suppressed gastric cancer cell growth by inducing endogenous miR-185 that directly targets epigenetic effectors DNMT1 and EZH2 in gastric cancer cells. In addition, ectopic expression of GKN1 upregulated Tip60 and downregulated HDAC1 in an miR-185-independent manner, thereby inducing cell-cycle arrest by regulating cell-cycle proteins in gastric cancer cells. Notably, GKN1 expression was inversely correlated with DNMT1 and EZH2 expression in a subset of 80 gastric cancer tissues and various gastric cancer cell lines. Interestingly, it was found that GKN1 exerted a synergistic anti-cancerous effect with 5-fluorouracil on tumor cell growth, which suggests a possible therapeutic intervention method for gastric cancer.\nQuestion: Does gKN1-miR-185-DNMT1 axis suppress gastric carcinogenesis through regulation of epigenetic alteration and cell cycle?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

In this study, we determined the contribution of rod pathways to normal refractive development and form deprivation (FD) myopia by testing Gnat1(-/-) mice, which lack functional rods due to a mutation in rod transducin-\u03b1.\nMETHODS: Refractive development was measured in Gnat1(-/-) (n = 30-36) and wild-type (WT) mice (n = 5-9) from 4 to 12 weeks of age. FD was induced monocularly from 4 weeks of age using head-mounted diffuser goggles (Gnat1(-/-), n = 9-10; WT, n = 7-8). Refractive state and ocular biometry were obtained weekly using a photorefractor, 1310 nm optical coherence tomography, and partial coherence interferometry. We measured retinal dopamine and its metabolite, DOPAC, using HPLC.\nRESULTS: During normal development, the refractions of WT mice started at 5.36 \u00b1 0.68 diopters (D) and became more hyperopic before plateauing at 7.78 \u00b1 0.64 D. In contrast, refractions in Gnat1(-/-) mice were stable at 7.39 \u00b1 1.22 D across all ages.

The sample was comprised of 812 participants (36% African American; 67% female) who were free of metabolic syndrome at baseline, had completed a baseline sleep questionnaire, and had metabolic syndrome evaluated 3 years after baseline. Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was measured cross-sectionally using a portable monitor in a subset of 290 participants. Logistic regression examined the risk of developing metabolic syndrome and its components according to individual sleep symptoms and insomnia syndrome.\nRESULTS: Specific symptoms of insomnia (difficulty falling asleep [DFA] and \"unrefreshing\" sleep), but not a syndromal definition of insomnia, were significant predictors of the development of metabolic syndrome. Loud snoring more than doubled the risk of developing the metabolic syndrome and also predicted specific metabolic abnormalities (hyperglycemia and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol).

HTLV-1 contains both regulatory and accessory genes in four pX open reading frames. pX ORF-II encodes two proteins, p13 and p30, whose roles are still being defined in the virus life cycle and in HTLV-1 virus-host cell interactions. Proviral clones of HTLV-1 with pX ORF-II mutations diminish the ability of the virus to maintain viral loads in vivo. p30 expressed exogenously differentially modulates CREB and Tax-responsive element-mediated transcription through its interaction with CREB-binding protein/p300 and while acting as a repressor of many genes including Tax, in part by blocking tax/rex RNA nuclear export, selectively enhances key gene pathways involved in T-cell signaling/activation.\nRESULTS: Herein, we analyzed the role of p30 in cell cycle regulation. Jurkat T-cells transduced with a p30 expressing lentivirus vector accumulated in the G2-M phase of cell cycle. We then analyzed key proteins involved in G2-M checkpoint activation. p30 expression in Jurkat T-cells resulted in an increase in phosphorylation at serine 216 of nuclear cell division cycle 25C (Cdc25C), had enhanced checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) serine 345 phosphorylation, reduced expression of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), diminished phosphorylation of PLK1 at tyrosine 210 and reduced phosphorylation of Cdc25C at serine 198. Finally, primary human lymphocyte derived cell lines immortalized by a HTLV-1 proviral clone defective in p30 expression were more susceptible to camptothecin induced apoptosis. Collectively these data are consistent with a cell survival role of p30 against genotoxic insults to HTLV-1 infected lymphocytes.\nQuestion: Does human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 p30 alter cell cycle G2 regulation of T lymphocytes to enhance cell survival?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

Increasing evidence suggests that circulating progenitor cells contribute to intimal pathology, and clinical studies have demonstrated a correlation between progenitor cells and the incidence of restenosis after cardiovascular interventions. The aims of this study were to characterize the temporal response of CD34+ progenitors following vascular injury in an ovine model and to evaluate an affinity pheresis approach to attenuate this response.\nMETHODS: An ovine model underwent either operative vascular injury or a nonvascular surgery (n = 3 per group). Blood was examined perioperatively over 2 weeks by flow cytometry. Next, an affinity pheresis approach to mediate systemic depletion of CD34 progenitors was designed. Custom agarose pheresis matrix with antibody affinity toward CD34 or an isotype control was evaluated in vitro. Next, following vascular injury, sheep underwent perioperative whole blood volume pheresis toward either the progenitor cell marker CD34 (n = 3) or an isotype control (n = 4) for 14 days. Animals were monitored by physical exam as well as complete blood counts. Cells recovered by pheresis were eluted and examined by flow cytometry.\nRESULTS: Flow cytometry revealed a focal surge of circulating CD34 cells after vascular injury but not among surgical controls (P = .05). Toward the goal of an approach to attenuate the surge of CD34 progenitors, an evaluation of high-flow affinity matrix revealed efficacy in removal of progenitors from ovine blood in vitro. Next, a separate group of animals undergoing affinity pheresis after vascular injury was evaluated to mediate systemic depletion of CD34+ cells. Again, a surge of CD34+ cells was observed among isotype pheresis animals following vascular intervention but was attenuated over 20-fold by a CD34 pheresis approach (P = .029). Furthermore, an average of 77 million CD34-positive cells were eluted from the CD34 pheresis matrix.

Forkhead box family membranes possess various kinds of properties as they mediate apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, autophagy, senescence and so on. Foxhead box Q1 (FOXQ1), which has a major impact on several kinds of tumor forming and metastasis, while whether it triggers ESCC remains largely obscure.\nMETHODS: To determine whether aberrant FOXQ1 expression in esophageal cancer, protein level and mRNA level of specimens of cancerous tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues were determined by western blot and real-time PCR.

Reporter gene assay was used to study the transcriptional regulation activity.\nRESULTS: FOXQ1 was highly expressed in esophageal cancerous tissues compared with adjacent non-cancerous tissues. FOXQ1 overexpression promotes ESCC tumor cell proliferation, whereas FOXQ1 silencing prevents ESCC tumor cell proliferation. FOXQ1 promotes ESCC metastasis via negatively modulation CDH1. CDH1 silencing could rescue the migratory ability which was blemished by FOXQ1 silencing.

It was reported that monomeric purified PS has poor PS-direct and that a subpopulation of multimeric purified PS has high PS-direct and high affinity for phospholipids. We independently examined the relative PS-direct and affinity for phospholipids of monomeric and multimeric PS and we obtained contrasting results.\nRESULTS: Unpurified recombinant protein S (rPS) was monomeric and had PS-direct potency similar to that of both PS in plasma and multimeric affinity-purified PS, as measured in plasma assays for PS-direct and in thrombin-generation assays. Multimers of unpurified rPS were not induced by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), pH 2.5, NaSCN, or barium adsorption/elution. Multimers were induced by chromatography in the presence of EDTA and thus may be concentration-dependent. In contrast to a different report, monomers, dimers, trimers, and higher-order PS forms were clearly separated in sedimentation velocity experiments and multimers were not dissociated by adding Ca(2+). Active plasma-derived and recombinant immunoaffinity-purified PS were fractionated into monomers and multimers. On a mass basis, monomers and multimers had similar specific PS-direct and ability to compete with prothrombinase components (factors Xa/Va) for limiting phospholipids.

This study is aimed at exploring the therapeutic effects of long-term treatment with two different beneficial bacterial strains (Bifidobacterium breve M-16\u2009V and Lactobacillus rhamnosus NutRes1) and a glucocorticoid (budesonide), as a reference treatment, on inflammatory response in a murine model for chronic allergic asthma.\nMETHODS: To mimic the chronic disease in asthmatic patients, we used the murine ovalbumin-induced asthma model combined with prolonged allergen exposure. Airway function; pulmonary airway inflammation; airway remodelling, mRNA expression of pattern recognition receptors, Th-specific cytokines and transcription factors in lung tissue; mast cell degranulation; in vitro T cell activation; and expression of Foxp3 in blood Th cells were examined.\nRESULTS: Lactobacillus rhamnosus reduced lung resistance to a similar extent as budesonide treatment in chronically asthmatic mice. Pulmonary airway inflammation, mast cell degranulation, T cell activation and airway remodelling were suppressed by all treatments. Beneficial bacteria and budesonide differentially modulated the expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs), nod-like receptors (NLRs), cytokines and T cell transcription factors. Bifidobacterium breve induced regulatory T cell responses in the airways by increasing Il10 and Foxp3 transcription in lung tissue as well as systemic by augmenting the mean fluorescence intensity of Foxp3 in blood CD4+ T cells.\nQuestion: Is bifidobacterium breve and Lactobacillus rhamnosus treatment as effective as budesonide at reducing inflammation in a murine model for chronic asthma?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

Recent studies have shown that CHD2 protein plays a critical role in embryonic development, tumor suppression and survival. Like other genes encoding members of the CHD family, pathogenic mutations in the CHD2 gene are expected to be implicated in human disease. In fact, there is emerging evidence suggesting that CHD2 might contribute to a broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders. Despite growing evidence, a description of the full phenotypic spectrum of this condition is lacking.\nMETHODS: We conducted a multicentre study to identify and characterise the clinical features associated with haploinsufficiency of CHD2. Patients with deletions of this gene were identified from among broadly ascertained clinical cohorts undergoing genomic microarray analysis for developmental delay, congenital anomalies and/or autism spectrum disorder.\nRESULTS: Detailed clinical assessments by clinical geneticists showed recurrent clinical symptoms, including developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy, behavioural problems and autism-like features without characteristic facial gestalt or brain malformations observed on magnetic resonance imaging scans.

We estimated the global effect of HbA\u2081(c) loci using a multilocus risk score, and used net reclassification to estimate genetic effects on diabetes screening.\nRESULTS: Ten loci reached genome-wide significant association with HbA(1c), including six new loci near FN3K (lead SNP/P value, rs1046896/P = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b2\u2076), HFE (rs1800562/P = 2.6 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b2\u2070), TMPRSS6 (rs855791/P = 2.7 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2074), ANK1 (rs4737009/P = 6.1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b2), SPTA1 (rs2779116/P = 2.8 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079) and ATP11A/TUBGCP3 (rs7998202/P = 5.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2079), and four known HbA\u2081(c) loci: HK1 (rs16926246/P = 3.1 \u00d7 10\u207b\u2075\u2074), MTNR1B (rs1387153/P = 4.0 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u00b9), GCK (rs1799884/P = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b2\u2070) and G6PC2/ABCB11 (rs552976/P = 8.2 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2078). We show that associations with HbA\u2081(c) are partly a function of hyperglycemia associated with 3 of the 10 loci (GCK, G6PC2 and MTNR1B). The seven nonglycemic loci accounted for a 0.19 (% HbA\u2081(c)) difference between the extreme 10% tails of the risk score, and would reclassify \u223c2% of a general white population screened for diabetes with HbA\u2081(c).\nQuestion: Do common variants at 10 genomic loci influence hemoglobin A\u2081 ( C ) levels via glycemic and nonglycemic pathways?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

While hyperplasia of the perihepatic lymph nodes has been described in patients with PSC, its prevalence and cause in IBD patients remains obscure. In the present study we address the question of whether ultrasound (US) examination is useful to detect perihepatic lymphadenopathy and improve the diagnostic accuracy for PSC in patients with underlying IBD.\nMETHODS: A total of 310 consecutive IBD patients were prospectively evaluated by US for enlarged perihepatic lymph nodes, as well as serologic testing for cholestasis-indicating enzymes. In patients with positive test results, viral or autoimmune liver disorders were excluded by serum testing. Next, the presence of PSC was confirmed/excluded by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC).\nRESULTS: Perihepatic lymphadenopathy was detected by US in 27 of 310 (9%) patients. In 9 (33%) of those, serologic testing identified an underlying autoimmune or viral hepatitis. In the remaining 18 patients, ERC confirmed PSC in 17 (94%) and excluded it in 1. Elevated cholestasis parameters were found in 43 of 310 (14%) patients and 5 (12%) of those were diagnosed with autoimmune or viral hepatitis. In the remaining 38 patients, ERC confirmed PSC in 15 (39%) and excluded it in 23 (61%). Therefore, when autoimmune or viral hepatitis was excluded, enlarged lymph nodes in US predicted PSC more accurately than conventional serum parameters alone (PPV 94 and 39%, respectively [ P<0.001]), and the sensitivity ratio increased by a factor of 1.13 in favor of the US examination.\nQuestion: Is sonographic detection of perihepatic lymphadenopathy an indicator for primary sclerosing cholangitis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

The recombinant viruses were evaluated for their replication capacity and susceptibility to PIs.\nRESULTS: The single 82M mutation within a wild-type subtype B or G background did not result in drug resistance. However, the in vitro effect of single PR mutations on PI susceptibility is not always distinguishable from wild-type virus, and particular background mutations and polymorphisms are required to detect significant differences in the drug susceptibility profile. Consequently, reverting the 82M mutation back to wild-type (82I) in a subtype G isolate from a patient that failed therapy with multiple other PR mutations did result in significant increases in susceptibility towards indinavir and lopinavir and minor increases in susceptibility towards amprenavir and atazanavir.

XBS decreased the histological damage and up-regulation of ICAM-1 observed in lungs of mice treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In cultured human pulmonary epithelial A549 cells, XBS and its components Morus alba and Glycyrrhiza uralensis suppressed the up-regulation of IL-8 and ICAM-1 in response to LPS. Production of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-8 by LPS-treated human THP-1 monomyelocytes was also suppressed by XBS. A549 cells expressed ICAM-1 in response to medium from LPS-treated THP-1 cells; expression was decreased by XBS.

SWI/SNF complexes are recruited to chromatin through multiple mechanisms, including specific DNA-binding factors (for example, heat shock transcription factor 4 (Hsf4) and paired box gene 6 (Pax6)), chromatin structural proteins (for example, high-mobility group A1 (HMGA1)) and/or acetylated core histones. Previous studies have shown that a single amino acid substitution (K798R) in the Brg1 ATPase domain acts via a dominant-negative (dn) mechanism. Genetic studies have demonstrated that Brg1 is an essential gene for early (that is, prior implantation) mouse embryonic development. Brg1 also controls neural stem cell maintenance, terminal differentiation of multiple cell lineages and organs including the T-cells, glial cells and limbs.\nRESULTS: To examine the roles of Brg1 in mouse lens development, a dnBrg1 transgenic construct was expressed using the lens-specific \u03b1A-crystallin promoter in postmitotic lens fiber cells. Morphological studies revealed abnormal lens fiber cell differentiation in transgenic lenses resulting in cataract. Electron microscopic studies showed abnormal lens suture formation and incomplete karyolysis (that is, denucleation) of lens fiber cells. To identify genes regulated by Brg1, RNA expression profiling was performed in embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) wild-type and dnBrg1 transgenic lenses. In addition, comparisons between differentially expressed genes in dnBrg1 transgenic, Pax6 heterozygous and Hsf4 homozygous lenses identified multiple genes coregulated by Brg1, Hsf4 and Pax6. DNase II\u03b2, a key enzyme required for lens fiber cell denucleation, was found to be downregulated in each of the Pax6, Brg1 and Hsf4 model systems. Lens-specific deletion of Brg1 using conditional gene targeting demonstrated that Brg1 was required for lens fiber cell differentiation, for expression of DNase II\u03b2, for lens fiber cell denucleation and indirectly for retinal development.\nQuestion: Is chromatin remodeling enzyme Brg1 required for mouse lens fiber cell terminal differentiation and its denucleation?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

This study was conducted to analyze in detail the T cell immune response against p205 and to investigate whether immunity to p205 may play a role in T cell-mediated immunopathology in active RA.\nMETHODS: Cibachron blue, protein A-Sepharose, and gel filtration on Sephacryl were used successively to enrich p205 from synovial fluid (SF). T lymphocytes from RA patients were isolated from the peripheral blood (PB), lymph nodes, and SF, and p205 and peptides derived from known sequences were assessed by T cell proliferation assays in the presence of IL-2.\nRESULTS: P205-specific proliferation of T cells was observed in PB as well as in SF. When p205 was isolated from RA SF, proliferation of RA T cells peaked on day 3. With p205 purified from SF from trauma patients, there was a significant shift of the maximum T cell proliferation to day 8. T cells were of CD4 or CD8 phenotype, and B cells did not proliferate to a significant degree. The T cell response to p205 was always higher for SF mononuclear cells (SFMC) compared with PBMC (P < 0.001). In 1 RA patient who underwent repeated leukapheresis, this led to a reproducible decline in p205-specific T cell proliferation to control levels. PB T cells specifically proliferating in response to p205 were detected in 20 of 32 RA patients (63%). Of 26 patients with other inflammatory rheumatic diseases, only 1 showed a minor response to p205, while normal donors did not demonstrate a significant T cell proliferation.

Inflammation, fibrosis and accelerated arteriosclerosis are typical features for chronic allograft injury. Growth factors participate in cell proliferation, differentiation and migration in this pathological process.\nOBJECTIVE: Here we studied the role of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in VSMC and monocyte-macrophage function in vitro. EGFR inhibition by erlotinib, a selective EGF tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was studied in VSMC proliferation and migration as well as monocyte-macrophage proliferation and differentiation.\nMETHODS: Rat coronary artery SMCs were used for VSMC studies. As a model for monocyte-macrophage proliferation and differentiation human monocytic cell line U937 was used. Phorbol ester TPA was used to induce these cells to differentiate into macrophages.\nRESULTS: Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B, a known VSMC inducer, caused 2.1-fold stimulation in VSMC proliferation compared to non-stimulated VSMC. Erlotinib prevented this VSMC proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, p < 0.001 in all groups compared to controls. PDGF-B stimulation increased VSMC migration to 2.5-fold when compared with non-stimulated cells. Erlotinib decreased VSMC migration dose-dependently and this effect was significant with all doses, p < 0.05.

C2C12 myoblasts grow more slowly without glucose irrespective of the presence of galactose, which is not consumed by the cells, and they fail to differentiate without glucose in the medium. Cells grown in a no-glucose medium (with or without galactose) have lower maximal respiration and spare respiratory capacity than cells grown in the presence of glucose.

We previously demonstrated increased L-type Ca channel current (ICa) in coronary smooth muscle cells (SMCs) of male swine compared with female swine. In male swine, endogenous testosterone increases ICa in SMCs through enhanced expression of the pore-forming \u03b11 subunit Cav1.2. Conversely, the role of sex hormones in female swine has not been previously investigated. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to determine the effect of ovariectomy on L-type Ca channel activity and expression in female Yucatan miniature swine.\nMETHODS: Sexually mature female swine were obtained from a breeder and randomly assigned to intact female (IF; n = 5) and ovariectomized (OVX; n = 6) groups.\nRESULTS: Sensitivity to depolarization-induced contractions was increased by ovariectomy.

Metaplastic ductal lesions are seen in pancreatitis as well as in specimens of pancreatic cancer and are thought to represent a condition with increased risk of neoplasia.

This has been suggested for flat duct-like lesions called tubular complexes and for lesions exhibiting a mucinous metaplasia. However, available studies are based on interpretation of static data rather than on direct evidence. Transdifferentiation from acinar to ductal cells has never been confirmed in the adult pancreas.\nMETHODS: Here, we use Cre-loxP-based genetic lineage tracing in vivo to investigate whether transdifferentiation of acinar cells contributes to regeneration and metaplasia in pancreatitis.\nRESULTS: The results show that transdifferentiation does not play a role in regeneration of normal tissue. Acinar cells are regenerated by preexisting acinar cells and not from other cell types. Three different types of metaplastic ductal lesions are observed and analyzed.

Sixteen weeks after 6-OHDA administration to newborn pigs, we found substantial myocardial adrenergic denervation associated with beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) downregulation. Despite decreased beta AR number, the dose of isoproterenol yielding 50% maximal heart rate change (ED50) was decreased, and heart rates during exercise showed increased responsiveness despite decreased circulating catecholamines. Thus, stimulation of fewer receptors yielded an increased response, implying improved signal transduction efficiency. Competitive binding studies with isoproterenol showed an increased proportion of beta AR with high-affinity binding in myocardial membranes from 6-OHDA pigs, suggesting that interaction between beta AR and cardiac G, may contribute to improved signal transduction efficiency. However, measures of adenylyl cyclase activity indicated marked reduction in beta AR-dependent and G2-dependent cAMP production in myocardial membranes from denervated animals despite a normal amount of cardiac Gs and decreased Gi.\nQuestion: Does myocardial adrenergic denervation supersensitivity depend on a postreceptor mechanism not linked with increased cAMP production?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

In both assays, fragments containing the second and third type 1 repeats but not the procollagen region inhibited angiogenesis and endothelial cell proliferation. To further define the sequences responsible for the angiostatic effect of TSP-1, we used synthetic peptides. The CAM assay defined 2 sequences that independently suppressed angiogenesis. The amino-terminal end of the type 1 repeats showed higher potency for inhibiting angiogenesis driven by basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), whereas the second region equally blocked angiogenesis driven by either FGF-2 or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Modifications of the active peptides revealed the specific amino acids required for the inhibitory response. One sequence included the conserved tryptophan residues in the amino-terminal end of the second and third type 1 repeats, and the other involved the amino acids that follow the CSVTCG sequence in the carboxy-terminus of these repeats.

In this study we investigated the potential of anti-inflammatory and anti-coagulant intervention strategies to inhibit age-related and radiation-induced atherosclerosis.\nRESULTS: ApoE(-/-) mice were given 0 or 14 Gy to the neck and the carotid arteries and aortic arches were harvested at 4 or 30 weeks after irradiation. Nitric oxide releasing aspirin (NCX 4016, 60 mg/kg/day) or aspirin (ASA, 30 or 300 mg/kg/day) were given continuously in the chow. High dose ASA effectively blocked platelet aggregation, while the low dose ASA or NCX 4016 had no significant effect on platelet aggregation. High dose ASA, but not NCX 4016, inhibited endothelial cell expression of VCAM-1 and thrombomodulin in the carotid arteries at 4 weeks after irradiation; eNOS and ICAM-1 levels were unchanged. After 30 weeks of follow-up, NCX 4016 significantly reduced the total number of lesions and the number of initial macrophage-rich lesions in the carotid arteries of unirradiated mice, but these effects were not seen in the brachiocephalic artery of the aortic arch (BCA). In contrast, high dose ASA lead to a decrease in the number of initial lesions in the BCA, but not in the carotid artery. Both high dose ASA and NCX 4016 reduced the collagen content of advanced lesions and increased the total plaque burden in the BCA of unirradiated mice. At 30 weeks after irradiation, neither NCX 4016 nor ASA significantly influenced the number or distribution of lesions, but high dose ASA lead to formation of collagen-rich \"stable\" advanced lesions in carotid arteries.

Preclinical studies have demonstrated that compensation with the less-impaired limb may have a detrimental inhibitory effect on the intact cortical hemisphere and could impede recovery of the more-impaired limb. However, evidence from detailed neurophysiological mapping studies in animal models is lacking.\nOBJECTIVE: The present study examines neurophysiological changes in the intact hemisphere of the rat following a unilateral ischemic infarct to cortical forelimb motor areas.\nMETHODS: A total of 8 rats were trained for 2 weeks on a reach and retrieval task prior to an ischemic infarct induced by the vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 injected into the cortical gray matter encompassing the 2 forelimb motor representations: the caudal forelimb area (CFA) and the rostral forelimb area (RFA). Animals were randomly assigned to an infarct/training group (n = 4) or an infarct/no-training group (ie, spontaneous recovery, n = 4). After a 5-week postinfarct period, motor areas of the intact hemisphere (CFA and RFA) were characterized using intracortical microstimulation techniques. The resulting maps of evoked movements were compared with maps derived from CFA and RFA in normal rats (normal, n = 5; normal/training, n = 4).\nRESULTS: Compared with the normal/no-training group, CFA representations were significantly smaller in the infarct/training group but not in the infarct/no-training group.

However, the mechanism through which early life stress contributes to disease development remains unclear. Previous studies have reported an association between early life stress and altered methylation of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4), a key candidate gene for several psychiatric disorders. These differences in methylation are influenced by sex and genetic variation in the SLC6A4-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR). Furthermore, one study indicated that stress during pregnancy may induce methylation changes in SLC6A4 in the newborn. The present study is the first to investigate whether early life stress during pregnancy impacts on SLC6A4 methylation in newborns, taking into account the influence of genetic variation and sex.\nMETHODS: Cord blood was obtained from newborns with high (n\u2009=\u200945) or low (n\u2009=\u200945) early life stress, defined as maternal stress during pregnancy. The effect on methylation of early life stress, 5-HTTLPR genotype, and sex was assessed at four cytosin-phosphate-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites in the promoter associated CpG island north shore (CpG 1 to 4). The epigenetic analyses focused on these CpG sites, since research has shown that CpG island shore methylation has functional consequences.\nRESULTS: Significant sex-specific methylation was observed, with females displaying higher methylation levels than males (p\u2009<\u20090.001).

However, the in vivo role of Trx2 in angiogenesis has not been defined. Here we used EC-specific transgenesis of Trx2 (Trx2-TG) in mice to determine the in vivo function of Trx2 in arteriogenesis and angiogenesis.\nRESULTS: In a femoral artery ligation model, Trx2-TG mice had enhanced capacity in limb perfusion recovery and ischemic reserve capacity compared to the nontransgenic littermates. Ischemia-initiated arteriogenesis in the upper limb was augmented in Trx2-TG mice. Trx2-TG mice also showed significantly enhanced capillary formation and maturation in the lower limb. In nontransgenic limb, ischemia specifically induced a downregulation of Trx2 protein, leading to increased oxidative stress, ASK1 activation, and EC apoptosis. In contrast, Trx2-TG maintained a constitutive level of Trx2, reducing the ischemia-induced deleterious responses. We then defined the mechanism by which Trx2 increases angiogenesis using ECs isolated from Trx2-TG mice. Trx2-TG ECs showed increased NO and NO-dependent migration. In addition, these cells were more resistant to oxidative stress-induced activation of ASK1 signaling and apoptosis. Moreover, Trx2-augmented EC survival is NO-independent. To define the relative contributions of Trx2-increased NO and Trx2-reduced ASK1 apoptotic activity to angiogenesis in vivo, we examined Trx2 effects on ischemia-induced angiogenesis in eNOS-deficient mice. The eNOS deletion caused severe impairment in the functional flow recovery in response to ischemia. Trx2 expression in eNOS-KO mice still dramatically inhibited ischemia-induced ASK1 and EC apoptosis, leading to an enhanced functional flow recovery.\nQuestion: Does endothelial-specific expression of mitochondrial thioredoxin promote ischemia-mediated arteriogenesis and angiogenesis?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

Leptin circulates in blood and acts on the brain, which sends downstream signals to regulate body weight. Leptin therapy has been successful in treating leptin deficient obese patients. However, high levels of leptin have been observed in more common forms of obesity indicating a state of leptin resistance which limits the application of leptin in the treatment of obesity. If the central effect of leptin could be by-passed and genes which respond to leptin treatment could be regulated directly, new therapeutic targets for the treatment of obesity may be possible.

We identified 214 genes that correlate with leptin mediated weight loss. Several biological processes such as mitochondrial metabolic pathways, lipid metabolic and catabolic processes, lipid biosynthetic processes, carboxylic acid metabolic processes, iron ion binding and glutathione S-transferases were downregulated after leptin administration. In contrast, genes involved in the immune system inflammatory response and lysosomal activity were found to be upregulated.

It was previously found that agave cell walls contain low lignin and relatively diverse non-cellulosic polysaccharides, suggesting unique recalcitrant features when compared to conventional C4 and C3 plants.\nRESULTS: Here, we report sugar release data from fungal enzymatic hydrolysis of non-pretreated and hydrothermally pretreated biomass that shows agave to be much less recalcitrant to deconstruction than poplar or switchgrass. In fact, non-pretreated agave has a sugar release five to eight times greater than that of poplar wood and switchgrass . Meanwhile, state of the art techniques including glycome profiling, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Simon's Stain, confocal laser scanning microscopy and so forth, were applied to measure interactions of non-cellulosic wall components, cell wall hydrophilicity, and enzyme accessibility to identify key structural features that make agave cell walls less resistant to biological deconstruction when compared to poplar and switchgrass.\nQuestion: Does agave prove to be a low recalcitrant lignocellulosic feedstock for biofuels production on semi-arid lands?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

Several factors, including treatment-related and patient-oriented factors, are involved in susceptibility to severe dermatitis. Genetic factors are also thought to be related to a patient's susceptibility to severe dermatitis. To elucidate genetic polymorphisms associated with a susceptibility to radiation-induced dermatitis, a large-scale single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis using DNA samples from 156 patients with breast cancer was conducted.\nMETHODS: Patients were selected from more than 3,000 female patients with early breast cancer who received radiotherapy after undergoing breast-conserving surgery. The dermatitis group was defined as patients who developed dermatitis at a National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria grade of > or =2. For the SNP analysis, DNA samples from each patient were subjected to the genotyping of 3,144 SNPs covering 494 genes.\nRESULTS: SNPs that mapped to two genes, ABCA1 and IL12RB2, were associated with radiation-induced dermatitis. In the ABCA1 gene, one of these SNPs was a nonsynonymous coding SNP causing R219K (P = 0.0065). As for the IL12RB2 gene, the strongest association was observed at SNP-K (rs3790568; P = 0.0013). Using polymorphisms of both genes, the probability of severe dermatitis was estimated for each combination of genotypes.

We aimed to understand the relationship between CTNNB1 mutation types, tumor phenotype, and level of \u00df-catenin activation in malignant transformation. To this purpose, CTNNB1 mutation spectrum was analyzed in 220 HCAs, 373 HCCs, and 17 borderline HCA/HCC lesions. \u00df-catenin activation level was assessed in tumors by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry (IHC), in cellulo by TOP-Flash assay. Overall, \u00df-catenin activity was higher in malignant mutated tumors, compared to adenomas, and this was related to a different spectrum of CTNNB1 mutations in HCCs and HCAs. In benign tumors, we defined three levels of \u00df-catenin activation related to specific mutations: (1) S45, K335, and N387 mutations led to weak activation; (2) T41 mutations were related to moderate activity; and (3) highly active mutations included exon 3 deletions and amino acid substitutions within the \u00df-TRCP binding site (D32-S37). Accordingly, in vitro, K335I and N387K mutants showed a lower activity than S33C. Tumors with highly active mutations demonstrated strong/homogeneous glutamine synthase (GS) staining and were associated with malignancy. In contrast, weak mutants demonstrated heterogeneous pattern of GS staining and were more frequent in HCAs except for the S45 mutants identified similarly in 20% of mutated HCAs and HCCs; however, in most of the HCCs, the weak S45 mutant alleles were duplicated, resulting in a final high \u00df-catenin activity.\nQuestion: Does genotype-phenotype correlation of CTNNB1 mutations reveal different \u00df-catenin activity associated with liver tumor progression?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

We aimed to compare safety, feasibility, and clinical outcomes for repairs in patients who previously underwent prostatectomy to control subjects.\nMETHODS: We undertook a case-control study using a prospectively collected database. From 2004, all patients were routinely offered totally extraperitoneal laparoscopic repair. All patients who had a history of previous prostatectomy were identified and compared to a matched control group. Both operative and follow-up data were analyzed.\nRESULTS: Of 987 patients undergoing surgery during this time period, 52 prostatectomy patients were identified (44% open, 44% robotic, 3% laparoscopic) and matched to 102 control subjects. Accounting for bilateral repairs, 203 hernia repairs had been performed. Patients were well matched for age and American Society of Anesthesiologists score. Operative time was longer for prostatectomy patients (mean, 70 vs. 52 min, p < 0.0001); however, this reduced over time when comparing the first and second half prostatectomy patients (77 vs. 63 min, p = 0.144). Overall, there were no intraoperative or major postoperative complications and only one conversion (prostatectomy group). No significant differences were found for rates of minor postoperative complications, length of stay, or recurrence (n = 1, control group). No difference was observed for chronic pain, and all patients in each group reported satisfaction with surgery at contemporary follow-up.\nQuestion: Is totally extraperitoneal inguinal hernia repair in patients previously having prostatectomy feasible , safe , and effective?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

This reflected the decline in thymic export as shown by recent thymic emigrant (RTE) enumeration. Orchidectomy increased the count of both of the major T-splenocyte subsets in young rats, and they (differently from controls) remained stable with aging. The CD4+:CD8+ T-splenocyte ratio in ORX rats shifted towards CD4+ cells compared to age-matched controls. Although in the major T-cell subsets in the blood and spleen from aged ORX rats the numbers of RTEs were comparable to the corresponding values in age-matched controls, the numbers of mature na\u00efve and memory/activated cells substantially differed. Compared with age-matched controls, in aged ORX rats the numbers of CD4+ mature na\u00efve PBLs and splenocytes were reduced, whereas those of CD4+ memory/activated cells (predictive of early mortality) were increased. Additionally, in spleens from aged ORX rats, despite unaltered thymic export, CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ and natural killer T cell counts were greater than in age-matched controls.\nQuestion: Do androgens contribute to age-associated changes in peripheral T-cell homeostasis acting in a thymus-independent way?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

ST-elevation myocardial infarction was correctly identified or excluded by EASI with a specificity of 94% (95% CI, 89%-97%) and a sensitivity of 93% (95% CI, 86%-97%; using cECG as the gold standard). Of 118 patients with enzyme elevations, an almost identical number (72 [61% by EASI] and 73 [62% by cECG]) had ST elevations. Both techniques were equivalent in predicting subsequent enzyme elevation (identical, 108/143; 75% of ACS and ST-elevation myocardial infarction ECGs by EASI and cECG). Thus, both ECG methods had exactly the same specificity of 59% (95% CI, 48%-69%) and sensitivity of 91% (95% CI, 85%-96%) for detecting myocardial injury.\nQuestion: Is a vector-based , 5-electrode , 12-lead monitoring ECG ( EASI ) equivalent to conventional 12-lead ECG for diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

Previously, we found that epigenetic mechanisms underlie the down-regulation of SOSTDC1 in gastric cancer cells. The aim of this study was to assess the putative epigenetic regulation of SOSTDC1 expression in breast cancer cells.\nMETHODS: Microarray-based expression profiling was performed in a series of primary breast cancers and matched normal tissues. Real-time PCR was performed to assess SOSTDC1 and E4BP4 mRNA levels in MCF7, BT549, MBMDA231, T47D (breast cancer) and HEK293T (normal kidney) cell lines. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) were performed to assess the methylation level of the SOSTDC1 gene promoter, and 5-Aza 2-deoxycytidine (5'-Aza-dC) treatment was used to induce its demethylation. A luciferase assay was used to measure SOSTDC1 promoter activity in vitro. Stable shRNA-mediated knockdown of E4BP4 was carried out in MCF7 cells and confirmed by Western blotting. Finally, MCF7 cell proliferation and survival were measured by MTS assay.\nRESULTS: We found that SOSTDC1 is frequently down-regulated in primary breast cancers (98.2%) and in all breast cancer cell lines tested. MSP and BSP analyses revealed SOSTC1 promoter hypermethylation at CpG sites. 5'-Aza-dC treatment induced a striking down-regulation of SOSTDC1 gene expression, whereas BSP analysis showed demethylation of its promoter. Subsequent in silico SOSTDC1 promoter analysis indicated the presence of putative transcriptional repressor E4BP4 binding sites, and promoter deletion studies indeed revealed repressor binding regions encompassing these E4BP4 binding sites. Relative quantification of E4BP4 expression showed an inverse correlation to SOSTDC1 expression in the breast cancer cell lines tested. Exogenous over-expression of E4BP4 in HEK-293 and BT549 cells reduced SOSTDC1 expression and its promoter activity, respectively. Stable shRNA-mediated E4BP4 BT549 and MCF7 knock-down cells treated with 5'-Aza-dC exhibited up-regulation of SOSTDC1 expression and a concomitant inhibition of cell proliferation and survival.\nQuestion: Is e4BP4 a repressor of epigenetically regulated SOSTDC1 expression in breast cancer cells?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

Antisense-oligonucleotide (AS) c-fos-null mice were used for this purpose.\nMETHODS: A rectangular piece of corneal tissue (2 x2 mm) was obtained from each eye of recently killed adult C57BL/6 mice and was incubated for 11 h in culture medium with 8 microM c-fos AS or c-jun AS probe. Sense probes were used for negative control. A rectangular section of corneal tissue was also obtained from each eye of c-fos(-/-), c-fos(+/-) and c-fos(+/+) mice and was organ-cultured for 11 h. The length of the path of epithelial spreading on stromal cut surface (both sides) was measured in hematoxylin-eosin-stained specimens. Data were analyzed by unpaired Student's t-test.\nRESULTS: Addition of c-fos AS to the medium decreased the length of epithelial spread to 40.36% of that in the control with the S probe. Addition of c-jun AS decreased the length of epithelial spreading rate to 42.71% of control with S probe.

NQO1 activity and mRNA expression were determined. The cells were pretreated with dicoumarol at relevant concentrations before treatment with gemcitabine. Cytotoxicity was determined by staining with fluorescent dyes. Oxidant formation was examined by assay of cellular glutathione levels and reactive oxygen species production by using dihydrofluorescein diacetate. Measurement of mitochondrial transmembrane potential was performed by using JC-1 fluorescent probe.

Because the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is involved in liver homeostasis and regeneration and in liver carcinogenesis, we investigated here a role for Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the embryonic liver. A cyclization recombination (Cre)/locus of X-over P1 (loxP) strategy was chosen to perform adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) invalidation in order to activate ectopic beta-catenin signaling in hepatoblasts; an appropriate transgenic model expressing the Cre recombinase was used. Phenotypic and immunolocalization studies, together with messenger RNA analyses, by microarray and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction approaches were performed on this model during normal hepatogenesis. The loss of Apc allowed beta-catenin activation in the hepatoblasts after the formation of the liver bud and led to embryonic lethality. In this model, the liver became hypoplastic, and hepatocyte differentiation failed, whereas beta-catenin-activated ducts developed and gave rise to fully differentiated bile ducts when transplanted into adult recipient livers. Microarray analyses suggested that beta-catenin plays a role in repressing the hepatocyte genetic program and remodeling the ductal plate.

Discovery of functional variants within genes at these loci is required to confirm their role in Alzheimer disease (AD). Single nucleotide polymorphisms that influence gene expression (eSNPs) constitute an important class of functional variants. We therefore investigated the influence of the novel LOAD risk loci on human brain gene expression.\nMETHODS: We measured gene expression levels in the cerebellum and temporal cortex of autopsied AD subjects and those with other brain pathologies (\u223c400 total subjects). To determine whether any of the novel LOAD risk variants are eSNPs, we tested their cis-association with expression of 6 nearby LOAD candidate genes detectable in human brain (ABCA7, BIN1, CLU, MS4A4A, MS4A6A, PICALM) and an additional 13 genes \u00b1100 kb of these SNPs.

MR images were retrospectively reviewed for signal intensity alterations. Clinical improvement of patients was assessed by comparing pre- and postoperative Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale scores.\nRESULTS: Seventeen patients out of 25 (68%) exhibited T(1)-weighted hypointense/T(2)-weighted hyperintense signal abnormalities in the putamen and globus pallidus on MR images.

Under this condition, hPepT1 promoter activity, mRNA and protein expression levels were increased as assessed by luciferase assay, real-time RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. hPepT1 transport activity was accordingly increased by approximately 2.5-fold. Butyrate did not alter hPepT1 mRNA half-life indicating that butyrate acts at the transcriptional level. Molecular analyses revealed that Cdx2 is the most important transcription factor for butyrate-induced increase of hPepT1 expression and activity in Caco2-BBE cells. Butyrate-activated Cdx2 binding to hPepT1 promoter was confirmed by gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Moreover, Caco2-BBE cells overexpressing Cdx2 exhibited greater hPepT1 expression level than wild-type cells.

Each druse is in a central vacuole surrounded by chloroplasts. All hypodermal cell walls are thin, except for thick lowermost periclinal walls associated with the upper periclinal walls of the subtending palisade cells. These thick walls display 'quilted' impressions (mounds) formed by many subtending palisade cells. Conspicuous depressions occur in most mounds, and each depression contains what appear to be many plasmodesmata. These depressions are opposite similar regions in adjacent thin palisade periclinal walls, and they can be considered special pit fields that represent thin translucent regions ('windows' or 'skylights'). Druses in the vacuoles of palisade cells occur below these pit field regions and are surrounded by conspicuous cytoplasmic chloroplasts with massive grana oriented perpendicular to the crystals, probably providing for an efficient photosynthetic system under low-intensity light.\nMETHODS: Leaf clearings and fractures, light microscopy and crossed polarizers, general and histochemical staining, and transmission and scanning electron microscopy were used to examine these structures.\nRESULTS: Druses in the vacuoles of palisade cells occur below the thin pit field regions in the wall interface, suggesting an interesting physical relationship that could provide a pathway for light waves, filtered through the multiple hypodermis.

Immunofluorescent studies demonstrated that PML, SUMO-1, HSP70 and 20S proteasomes aggregated to form nuclear inclusions in multiple cell lines transfected with vectors expressing puromycin (puro) resistance in regions distinct from nucleoli. This effect does not occur in cells transfected with identical vectors expressing other antibiotic resistance genes or with vectors from which the pac sequence has been deleted.

GISTs and leiomyomas had a similar intragastric distribution and similar locations within the gastric wall. Therefore, patients with GISTs were chosen as the study group and those with leiomyomas were chosen as the control group. Dyspepsia symptom questionnaires were used to investigate and compare the gastrointestinal symptoms of patients with GISTs and those with gastric leiomyomas before and after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). The questionnaires evaluated symptoms such as epigastric pain, heartburn, regurgitation, epigastric discomfort, nausea and vomiting, abdominal bloating, and eructation. Symptoms were assessed using a four-point scoring scale.\nRESULTS: GISTs were the most common gastric submucosal lesion (67 cases, 40.12%), followed by leiomyomas (38 cases, 22.75%). Both groups were similar in terms of gender distribution (P = 0.49), intragastric location (P = 0.525), and originating layer within the gastric wall (P = 0.449), but leiomyomas were more commonly found in the proximal fundus (P < 0.05).

Strikingly, blocking sensory input bilaterally, by simultaneously transecting both IONs, results in rescued callosal projection. In contrast, non-simultaneous bilateral ION transection has the same effect as unilateral transection. Similar results are obtained by lesion of whisker hair follicles. c-Fos-positive neurons in brain slices treated with KCl is decreased more in contralateral cortex with unilateral removal of sensory input, but decreased similarly in both cortices in mice with simultaneous bilateral removal of sensory input. Frequency of sEPSC of cortical neurons is also reduced in contralateral cortex with the unilateral removal of sensory input, but equally reduced on both sides with the bilateral removal of sensory input, suggesting that unbalanced bilateral sensory input might lead to mismatched neuronal activity between the two cortices and contribute to the formation of callosal projection.\nQuestion: Is sensory input required for callosal axon targeting in the somatosensory cortex?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

Lesioned tissues included muscle, nerve, water canal and dermis. Animals were allowed to heal for up to four weeks (2, 6, 12, 20, and 28 days post-injury) before sacrificed. Tissues were sectioned in a cryostat and changes in cellular and tissue elements during repair were evaluated using classical dyes, immmuohistochemistry and phalloidin labeling. In addition, the temporal and spatial distribution of cell proliferation in the animals was assayed using BrdU incorporation. We found that cellular events associated with wound healing in H. glaberrima correspond to those previously shown to occur during intestinal regeneration. These include: (1) an increase in the number of spherule-containing cells, (2) remodeling of the extracellular matrix, (3) formation of spindle-like structures that signal dedifferentiation of muscle cells in the area flanking the lesion site and (4) intense cellular division occurring mainly in the coelomic epithelium after the first week of regeneration.\nQuestion: Do common cellular events occur during wound healing and organ regeneration in the sea cucumber Holothuria glaberrima?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

The protein levels of NADPH oxidases were assessed by Western blotting. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was measured using dihydroethidium fluorescence imaging. The concentrations of cGMP were measured using ELISA kit.\nRESULTS: Aortic rings from control, BT-treated and E2-treated OVX rats exhibited a greater increase in Phe-induced contraction after inhibition of NO synthase compared with those from OVX rats. ACh-induced endothelium-dependent relaxations were augmented in aortae and renal arteries in BT/E2-treated OVX rats than in OVX rats. BT/E2 treatment improved flow-mediated dilatation in small mesenteric resistance arteries of OVX rats. BT/E2 treatment restored the eNOS phosphorylation level and reversed the up-regulation of NADPH oxidases and ROS overproduction in OVX rat aortae. ACh-stimulated cGMP production was significantly elevated in the aortae from BT- and E2-treated rats compared with those from OVX rats. BT/E2 treatment reduced circulating levels of total cholesterol.\nQuestion: Does chronic black tea extract consumption improve endothelial function in ovariectomized rats?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

Aspirin inhibits the synthesis of vasodilating prostaglandins, and, in principle, this inhibition might antagonize some of the effects of ACEi. But it is uncertain whether, in practice, this influences the effects of ACEi on mortality and major morbidity after MI.\nMETHODS: This overview sought individual patient data from all trials involving more than 1,000 patients randomly allocated to receive ACEi or control starting in the acute phase of MI (0-36 h from onset) and continuing for four to six weeks. Data on concomitant ASA use were available for 96,712 of 98,496 patients in four eligible trials (and for none of 1,556 patients in the one other eligible trial).\nRESULTS: Overall 30-day mortality was 7.1% among patients allocated to ACEi and 7.6% among those allocated to control, corresponding to a 7% (standard deviation [SD], 2%) proportional reduction (95% confidence interval 2% to 11%, p = 0.004). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was associated with similar proportional reductions in 30-day mortality among the 86,484 patients who were taking ASA (6% [SD, 3%] reduction) and among the 10,228 patients who were not (10% [SD, 5%] reduction: chi-squared test of heterogeneity between these reductions = 0.4; p = 0.5). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor produced definite increases in the incidence of persistent hypotension (17.9% ACEi vs. 9.4% control) and of renal dysfunction (1.3% ACEi vs. 0.6% control), but there was no good evidence that these effects were different in the presence or absence of ASA (chi-squared for heterogeneity = 0.4 and 0.0, respectively; both not significant).

Elevation of circulating non-esterified (i.e. free) fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations can lead to insulin resistance and plays a central role in the development of metabolic diseases. Circulating NEFA in healthy individuals shows a marked diurnal variation with maximum levels occurring at night, yet the impact of sleep loss on NEFA levels across the 24 h cycle remains unknown. We hypothesised that sleep restriction would alter hormones that are known to stimulate lipolysis and lead to an increase in NEFA levels.\nMETHODS: We studied 19 healthy young men under controlled laboratory conditions with four consecutive nights of 8.5 h in bed (normal sleep) and 4.5 h in bed (sleep restriction) in randomised order. The 24 h blood profiles of NEFA, growth hormone (GH), noradrenaline (norepinephrine), cortisol, glucose and insulin were simultaneously assessed. Insulin sensitivity was estimated by a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test.\nRESULTS: Sleep restriction relative to normal sleep resulted in increased NEFA levels during the nocturnal and early-morning hours. The elevation in NEFA was related to prolonged nocturnal GH secretion and higher early-morning noradrenaline levels.

Therefore, we sought to investigate the association of AS with hematological variables including RBCV.\nMETHODS: Fourteen healthy physically active individuals volunteered for the study (age=23\u00b12). RBCV, plasma volume (PV), and BV were calculated from measures of hematocrit and total hemoglobin mass (Hbmass) determined by CO-rebreathing. Carotid compliance with ultrasonography and carotid-ankle pulse wave velocity (PWV) were determined at rest and immediately after a maximal exercise test. The rationale for assessment of AS after exercise derives from the potential marked role of AS in the regulation of erythropoiesis in the setting of reduced central venous pressure.\nRESULTS: At rest, carotid compliance was positively associated with Hbmass, RBCV, BV, but not PV, with coefficients of determination (R(2)) ranging from 0.39 to 0.57.

Furthermore, comparative analysis of multiple genomes is necessary to determine whether patterns of gene duplication can be generalized across diverse lineages or are species-specific. Here we present results from an analysis comprising 68 duplication events in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. We partition the yeast duplicates into ohnologs (generated by a whole-genome duplication) and non-ohnologs (from small-scale duplication events) to determine whether their disparate origins commit them to divergent evolutionary trajectories and genomic attributes.\nRESULTS: We conclude that, for the most part, ohnologs tend to appear remarkably similar to non-ohnologs in their structural attributes (specifically the relative composition frequencies of complete, partial and chimeric duplicates), the discernible length of the duplicated region (duplication span) as well as genomic location. Furthermore, we find notable differences in the features of S. cerevisiae gene duplicates relative to those of another eukaryote, Caenorhabditis elegans, with respect to chromosomal location, extent of duplication and the relative frequencies of complete, partial and chimeric duplications.\nQuestion: Does variation in gene duplicate with low synonymous divergence in Saccharomyces cerevisiae relative to Caenorhabditis elegans?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

Upon activation, platelets generate reactive oxygen species and release proapoptotic and proinflammatory mediators as well as growth factors. In cold hepatic ischemia, adhesion of platelets to endothelial cells mediates sinusoidal endothelial cell apoptosis. Furthermore, platelet-derived serotonin mediates liver regeneration. We hypothesized that platelets may contribute to reperfusion injury and repair after normothermic hepatic ischemia. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of platelets in normothermic hepatic I/R injury using models of impaired platelet function and immune thrombocytopenia. Inhibition of platelet function in mice was achieved via clopidogrel feeding. Immune thrombocytopenia was induced via intraperitoneal injection of anti-CD41 antibody. Platelet-derived serotonin was investigated using mice lacking tryptophan hydroxylase 1. Mice were subjected to 60 minutes of partial hepatic ischemia and various time points of reperfusion. Hepatic injury was determined via AST and histological analysis of the necrotic area as well as leukocyte infiltration. Liver regeneration was determined via proliferating cell nuclear antigen and Ki67 immunohistochemistry. Neither inhibition of platelet function nor platelet depletion led to a reduction of I/R injury. Liver regeneration and repair were significantly impaired in platelet-depleted animals.

AS patients presented compensated myocardial adaptation to pressure overload. AS patients had significantly higher: concentration of endocannabinoid anandamide, expression of its degrading enzyme FAAH, and of cannabinoid receptor CB2, being predominantly located on cardiomyocytes. Cell density of macrophages and newly recruited leukocytes were higher in AS group, which together with increased expression of chemokines CCL2, CCL4 and CXCL8, and suppression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 indicates persistent inflammatory reaction. We found higher myofibroblast density and stronger tenascin C staining along with mRNA induction of tenascin C and CTGF in AS patients showing active myocardial remodeling.\nQuestion: Is myocardial hypertrophy associated with inflammation and activation of endocannabinoid system in patients with aortic valve stenosis?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

In the present study, we evaluated the effect of montelukast on airway myofibroblasts following low-dose allergen challenge (LDAC).\nMETHODS: Stable subjects with mild asthma were included in a two-center, randomized, parallel-group study. A 2-week run-in period was followed by LDAC and endobronchial biopsy. Subjects were then randomized to receive either montelukast, 10 mg/d, or placebo (n = 10 in each group) for 8 weeks in a double-blind manner; at the end of the treatment period, subjects underwent a second LDAC and endobronchial biopsy. The effect of treatment on myofibroblasts, fibroblasts, and inflammatory cells was examined using electron microscopy techniques.\nRESULTS: Treatment with montelukast showed no significant difference by comparison with placebo but did show a significant within-group treatment-related decrease in airway wall myofibroblasts not seen in the placebo group.

Recent studies have reported that genetic lesions and overexpression of oncoproteins in TGF-beta/Smads signalling cascade contribute to the TGF-beta resistance. Here, we showed that the overexpressed FOXG1 was involved in attenuating the anti-proliferative control of TGF-beta/Smads signalling in ovarian cancer.\nMETHODS: FOXG1 and p21(WAF1/CIP1) expressions were evaluated by real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blot and immunohistochemical analyses. The effect of FOXG1 on p21(WAF1/CIP1) transcriptional activity was examined by luciferase reporter assays. Cell lines stably expressing or short hairpin RNA interference-mediated knockdown FOXG1 were established for studying the gain-or-loss functional effects of FOXG1. XTT cell proliferation assay was used to measure cell growth of ovarian cancer cells.\nRESULTS: Quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analyses showed that FOXG1 was upregulated and inversely associated with the expression levels of p21(WAF1/CIP1) in ovarian cancer. The overexpression of FOXG1 was significantly correlated with high-grade ovarian cancer (P=0.025). Immunohistochemical analysis on ovarian cancer tissue array was further evidenced that FOXG1 was highly expressed and significantly correlated with high-grade ovarian cancer (P=0.048). Functionally, enforced expression of FOXG1 selectively blocked the TGF-beta-induced p21(WAF1/CIP1) expressions and increased cell proliferation in ovarian cancer cells. Conversely, FOXG1 knockdown resulted in a 20-26% decrease in cell proliferation together with 16-33% increase in p21(WAF1/CIP1) expression. Notably, FOXG1 was able to inhibit the p21(WAF1/CIP1) promoter activity in a p53-independent manner by transient reporter assays.\nQuestion: Does overexpression of FOXG1 contribute to TGF-beta resistance through inhibition of p21WAF1/CIP1 expression in ovarian cancer?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

Both positive and negative correlations have been found between CMS-associated orfs and the occurrence of CMS when CMS-associated orfs were expressed and targeted at mitochondria. Some orfs cause male sterility or semi-sterility, while some do not. Little is currently known about how mitochondrial factor regulates the expression of the nuclear genes involved in male sterility. The purpose of this study was to investigate the biological function of a candidate CMS-associated orf220 gene, newly isolated from cytoplasmic male-sterile stem mustard, and show how mitochondrial retrograde regulated nuclear gene expression is related to male sterility.\nRESULTS: It was shown that the ORF220 protein can be guided to the mitochondria using the mitochondrial-targeting sequence of the \u03b2 subunit of F1-ATPase (atp2-1). Transgenic stem mustard plants expressed the chimeric gene containing the orf220 gene and a mitochondrial-targeting sequence of the \u03b2 subunit of F1-ATPase (atp2-1). Transgenic plants were male-sterile, most being unable to produce pollen while some could only produce non-vigorous pollen. The transgenic stem mustard plants also showed aberrant floral development identical to that observed in the CMS stem mustard phenotype. Results obtained from oligooarray analysis showed that some genes related to mitochondrial energy metabolism were down-regulated, indicating a weakening of mitochondrial function in transgenic stem mustard. Some genes related to pollen development were shown to be down-regulated in transgenic stem mustard and the expression of some transcription factor genes was also altered.\nQuestion: Does mitochondrially-targeted expression of a cytoplasmic male sterility-associated orf220 gene cause male sterility in Brassica juncea?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

Type IV pili (tfp) are polarly located filamentous structures which are the major adhesins for attachment of P. aeruginosa to epithelial cells. The extension and retraction of tfp powers a mode of surface translocation termed twitching motility that is involved in biofilm development and also mediates the active expansion of biofilms across surfaces. Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (eATP) is a key \"danger\" signalling molecule that is released by damaged epithelial cells to alert the immune system to the potential presence of pathogens. As P. aeruginosa has a propensity for infecting damaged epithelial tissues we have explored the influence of eATP on tfp biogenesis and twitching motility-mediated biofilm expansion by P. aeruginosa.\nRESULTS: In this study we have found that eATP inhibits P. aeruginosa twitching motility-mediated expansion of interstitial biofilms at levels that are not inhibitory to growth. We have determined that eATP does not inhibit expression of the tfp major subunit, PilA, but reduces the levels of surface assembled tfp. We have also determined that the active twitching zone of expanding P. aeruginosa interstitial biofilms contain large quantities of eATP which may serve as a signalling molecule to co-ordinate cell movements in the expanding biofilm.

Parameterizing an age-structured epidemic model using published estimates of the pandemic H1N1-2009 and accounting for the cost effectiveness, we examined if the timing and length of school closure could be optimized.\nMETHODS: Age-structured renewal equation was employed to describe the epidemic dynamics of an influenza pandemic. School closure was assumed to take place only once during the course of the pandemic, abruptly reducing child-to-child transmission for a fixed length of time and also influencing the transmission between children and adults. Public health effectiveness was measured by reduction in the cumulative incidence, and cost effectiveness was also examined by calculating the incremental cost effectiveness ratio and adopting a threshold of 1.0 \u00d7 10\u2077 Japanese Yen/life-year.\nRESULTS: School closure at the epidemic peak appeared to yield the largest reduction in the final size, while the time of epidemic peak was shown to depend on the transmissibility. As the length of school closure was extended, we observed larger reduction in the cumulative incidence. Nevertheless, the cost effectiveness analysis showed that the cost of our school closure scenario with the parameters derived from H1N1-2009 was not justifiable.

The correlations of serum Gas6 concentration and clinicopathological characteristics of OSCC patients were assessed, and the prognostic significance of serum Gas6 was evaluated with a Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank test.\nRESULTS: The results showed that serum Gas6 concentration was significantly higher in OSCC patients than in controls (P < 0.05). OSCC patients with late TNM stage (III, IV) had a relatively high serum Gas6 concentration compared with those with early stage (I, II) (P < 0.01) and patients with poorly differentiated tumors had a higher level of serum Gas6 than those with well-differentiated tumors (P < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that high serum Gas6 was an independent risk factor for lymph nodal metastases in OSCC patients (OR = 2.79, 95% CI: 1.72-4.48). For predicting OSCC development, ROC curve analysis showed a sensitivity of 0.63 with a specificity of 0.92 (AUC = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.74-0.85).

Here we describe a system of vectors for display of proteins on the surface of B. subtilis spores.\nRESULTS: We have designed and constructed a set of 16 vectors for ectopic integration which can be used for spore surface display of heterologous proteins. There is a selection of five coat proteins: CotB, CotC, CotG, CotZ and CgeA which can be used for construction of fusions. Three of these (CotB, CotC and CotG) enable obtaining N-terminal and C-terminal fusions and other two (CotZ and CgeA) are designed to produce C-terminal fusions only. All the vectors enable introduction of an additional peptide linker between anchor and displayed protein to enhance surface display. As a selection marker trophic genes are used. Additionally we describe an example application of presented vector system to display CagA protein of Helicobacter pylori in fusion with CgeA spore coat protein.\nQuestion: Do a system of vectors for Bacillus subtilis spore surface display?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}

Over the six menstrual cycle follow-up time, after cessation of contraception, 135 pregnancies were conceived.\nRESULTS: The likelihood of pregnancy occurring in a single menstrual cycle was inversely associated with the 8-oxodG level (P < 0.01). The odds ratio of pregnancy in each of the first three or all six follow-up menstrual cycles was 0.42 (0.23-0.78; 95% CI) and 0.61 (0.36-0.91) per unit increase in the log 8-oxodG/100 000 dG ratio after adjustment for potential confounders, (including sperm concentration) respectively. The intra-individual coefficient of variation of 8-oxodG in 2-6 monthly repeated sperm samples from 116 men was 19% for the 8-oxodG/dG ratio, whereas the inter-individual coefficient of variation was 49%.

Clinical examination, semen analysis, serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and testicular FNAC were done. Men with normal volume azoospermia with normal spermatogenesis on FNAC and palpable vas were offered scrotal exploration for microsurgical vasoepididymal anastomosis (VEA). Patients in whom reconstruction was not feasible intraoperatively were analyzed for the causes of failure. The FNAC, FSH and biopsy of these patients were compared.\nRESULTS: 77 men fulfilled the inclusion criteria. In 38 men, sperm was present in the epididymal fluid and VEA was performed. In 39 men, reconstruction was not feasible. Thirty-four of these 39 men had normal FSH and testicular volume. In 5 of these 39 men, serum FSH was high (mean 17.48 mIU/ml) and testes were small in size (mean volume 14.5 ml).

These proteins also regulate several mRNA coding genes; however, it remains unclear exactly what percentage of the mRNA component of the transcriptome these proteins control. To address this question, we used the pyCRAC software package developed in our laboratory to analyze CRAC and PAR-CLIP data for Nrd1-Nab3-RNA interactions.\nRESULTS: We generated high-resolution maps of Nrd1-Nab3-RNA interactions, from which we have uncovered hundreds of new Nrd1-Nab3 mRNA targets, representing between 20 and 30% of protein-coding transcripts. Although Nrd1 and Nab3 showed a preference for binding near 5' ends of relatively short transcripts, they bound transcripts throughout coding sequences and 3' UTRs. Moreover, our data for Nrd1-Nab3 binding to 3' UTRs was consistent with a role for these proteins in the termination of transcription. Our data also support a tight integration of Nrd1-Nab3 with the nutrient response pathway. Finally, we provide experimental evidence for some of our predictions, using northern blot and RT-PCR assays.\nQuestion: Do pAR-CLIP data indicate that Nrd1-Nab3-dependent transcription termination regulates expression of hundreds of protein coding genes in yeast?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}
