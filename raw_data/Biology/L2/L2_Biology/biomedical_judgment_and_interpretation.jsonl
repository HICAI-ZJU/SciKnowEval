Preclinical studies suggest that bortezomib has synergistic activity with rituximab, which provides a rationale for the exploration of treatment combinations.\nMETHODS: The activity and safety of bortezomib in combination with rituximab and dexamethasone were investigated in patients with relapsed or chemotherapy-refractory mantle cell lymphoma. A treatment cycle consisted of bortezomib (1.3 mg/m² on days 1, 4, 8, and 11; six 21-day cycles), rituximab (375 mg/m², day 1) and dexamethasone (40 mg orally, days 1 to 4). Responding patients received four consolidating doses of rituximab. Sixteen patients with progressive mantle cell lymphoma after a median of three prior lines of therapy were enrolled.\nRESULTS: The overall response rate was 81.3% (13 patients), with seven patients achieving a complete response (43.8%). Six of these patients were also negative for disease activity by positron emission tomography scanning. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 12.1 and 38.6 months, respectively. In patients achieving a complete response, the median progression-free survival and overall survival have not yet been reached. Adverse events (greater than grade II) included thrombocytopenia (37.5%), fatigue (18.8%) and peripheral neuropathy (12.5%).

Cytokine levels were quantified by ELISA and patients were assessed for clinical and laboratory variables. This assessment included disease activity measures [Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI), Disease Activity Score for 28 joints (DAS28)] and a Health Assessment Questionnaire.\nRESULTS: The IL-17A, IL-6, IL-22 and IFN-γ were significantly reduced in a dose response after simvastatin treatment (50 μM, p = 0.0005; p < 0.0001; p < 0.02; p = 0.0005, respectively).

However, there are no established predictors of clinical benefit. Pemetrexed inhibits multiple enzymes involved in pyrimidine and purine synthesis, but the main target is thymidylate synthase (TS). After cellular uptake pemetrexed is converted into more effective polyglutamated forms by folylpoly-γ-glutamate synthetase (FPGS). We hypothesized that FPGS and TS protein expressions are associated with clinical outcome after pemetrexed-based chemotherapy.\nMETHODS: Pretreatment tumor samples from 84 patients with histologically confirmed MPM, who received pemetrexed combined with platinum (79 of 84) or single-agent pemetrexed (5 of 84) as first-line treatment, were retrospectively analyzed.

Because the DBT detector panel is typically stationary during the source rotation, antiscatter grids are not generally compatible with DBT; thus, a software-based scatter correction is required. This work proposes a fully iterative scatter correction method that uses a novel fast Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) with a tissue-composition ratio estimation technique for DBT imaging.\nMETHODS: To apply MCS to scatter estimation, the material composition in each voxel should be known. To overcome the lack of prior accurate knowledge of tissue composition for DBT, a tissue-composition ratio is estimated based on the observation that the breast tissues are principally composed of adipose and glandular tissues. Using this approximation, the composition ratio can be estimated from the reconstructed attenuation coefficients, and the scatter distribution can then be estimated by MCS using the composition ratio. The scatter estimation and image reconstruction procedures can be performed iteratively until an acceptable accuracy is achieved. For practical use, (i) the authors have implemented a fast MCS using a graphics processing unit (GPU), (ii) the MCS is simplified to transport only x-rays in the energy range of 10-50 keV, modeling Rayleigh and Compton scattering and the photoelectric effect using the tissue-composition ratio of adipose and glandular tissues, and (iii) downsampling is used because the scatter distribution varies rather smoothly.\nRESULTS: The authors have demonstrated that the proposed method can accurately estimate the scatter distribution, and that the contrast-to-noise ratio of the final reconstructed image is significantly improved. The authors validated the performance of the MCS by changing the tissue thickness, composition ratio, and x-ray energy. The authors confirmed that the tissue-composition ratio estimation was quite accurate under a variety of conditions. Our GPU-based fast MCS implementation took approximately 3 s to generate each angular projection for a 6 cm thick breast, which is believed to make this process acceptable for clinical applications. In addition, the clinical preferences of three radiologists were evaluated; the preference for the proposed method compared to the preference for the convolution-based method was statistically meaningful (p < 0.05, McNemar test).\nQuestion: Do fully iterative scatter corrected digital breast tomosynthesis using GPU-based fast Monte Carlo simulation and composition ratio update?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

It is linked to many physiological functions in human cells including stress response, protein degradation, organelle turnover, caspase-independent cell death and tumor suppression. Malignant transformation is frequently associated with deregulation of autophagy and several tumor suppressors can modulate autophagic processes. The tumor suppressor p53 can induce autophagy after metabolic or genotoxic stress through transcriptionally-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In this study we expand on the former mechanism by functionally characterizing a p53 family target gene, ISG20L1 under conditions of genotoxic stress.\nRESULTS: We identified a p53 target gene, ISG20L1, and show that transcription of the gene can be regulated by all three p53 family members (p53, p63, and p73). We generated an antibody to ISG20L1 and found that it localizes to the nucleolar and perinucleolar regions of the nucleus and its protein levels increase in a p53- and p73-dependent manner after various forms of genotoxic stress. When ectopically expressed in epithelial cancer-derived cell lines, ISG20L1 expression decreased clonogenic survival without a concomitant elevation in apoptosis and this effect was partially rescued in cells that were ATG5 deficient. Knockdown of ISG20L1 did not alter 5-FU induced apoptosis as assessed by PARP and caspase-3 cleavage, sub-G1 content, and DNA laddering. Thus, we investigated the role of ISG20L1 in autophagy, a process commonly associated with type II cell death, and found that ISG20L1 knockdown decreased levels of autophagic vacuoles and LC3-II after genotoxic stress as assessed by electron microscopy, biochemical, and immunohistochemical measurements of LC3-II.\nQuestion: Is iSG20L1 a p53 family target gene that modulates genotoxic stress-induced autophagy?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

Recent studies have identified the WAVE family of proteins as critical mediators of Rac1-induced actin reorganization in other cell types. However, whether these proteins participate in actin reorganization at the IS or signaling pathways in T cells has not been investigated.\nRESULTS: By using a combination of biochemical, genetic, and cell biology approaches, we provide evidence that WAVE2 is recruited to the IS, is biochemically modified, and is required for actin reorganization and beta-integrin-mediated adhesion after TCR crosslinking.

P. falciparum glycerol kinase catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of glycerol to glycerol-3-phosphate, a major phospholipid precursor.\nMETHODS: The P. falciparum glycerol kinase gene was disrupted using double crossover homologous DNA recombination to generate a knockout parasite line. Southern hybridization and mRNA analysis were used to verify gene disruption. Parasite growth rates were monitored by flow cytometry. Radiolabelling studies were used to assess incorporation of glycerol into parasite phospholipids.\nRESULTS: Disruption of the P. falciparum glycerol kinase gene produced viable parasites, but their growth was significantly reduced to 56.5±1.8% when compared to wild type parasites.

We previously reported phasic changes in action potential frequency in the dorsomedial and dorsolateral striatum after cues that signaled alcohol availability, prompting approach behavior.\nMETHODS: We investigated the hypothesis that dopamine transmission modulates these phasic firing changes. Rats were trained to self-administer alcohol, and neuronal activity was monitored with extracellular electrophysiology during \"anticipatory\" cues that signaled the start of the operant session.

Infiltrating neutrophils constitute the first line of defense that precedes a second wave of emigrating monocytes reinforcing the inflammatory reaction. The mechanisms initiating this sequential process remained largely obscure.\nRESULTS: Using advanced in vivo microscopy and in vitro/ex vivo techniques, we identified individual spatiotemporal expression patterns of selectins and their principal interaction partners on neutrophils, resident/inflammatory monocytes, and endothelial cells. Coordinating the intraluminal trafficking of neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes to common sites of extravasation, selectins assign different sites to these immune cells for their initial interactions with the microvascular endothelium. Whereas constitutively expressed leukocyte L-selectin/CD62L and endothelial P-selectin/CD62P together with CD44 and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1/CD162 initiate the emigration of neutrophils, de novo synthesis of endothelial E-selectin/CD62E launches the delayed secondary recruitment of inflammatory monocytes. In this context, P-selectin/CD62P and L-selectin/CD62L together with P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1/CD162 and CD44 were found to regulate the flux of rolling neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes, whereas E-selectin/CD62E selectively adjusts the rolling velocity of inflammatory monocytes.

A total of 101 consecutive surgically resected peripheral adenocarcinomas of the lung measuring 3.0cm or less in the maximum dimension on HRCT were examined both radiologically and histologically. All CT scans ware reviewed by three chest radiologists or pulmonologists. The following parameters were measured on HRCT: the greatest diameter of tumor on found on all CT cuts (Td), the greatest diameter of consolidation found on all CT cuts (Cdmax), and the greatest diameter of consolidation found on a particular CT cut (Cd). Consolidation to tumor size ratio at respective maximum dimensions was calculated as Cdmax/Td, and consolidation to tumor size ratio on the slice image with the maximum tumor dimension was calculated as Cd/Td. One pathologist reviewed all pathological specimens to determine the size of tumor, evidence of vessel invasion, etc. without any information of HRCT, and we compared CT findings with pathological findings.\nRESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between tumors with pathologic T1N0M0 adenocarcinoma without vessel invasion (least invasive disease: LID) and tumors with lymph node involvement or vessel invasion (invasive disease: ID) in each parameter.

Baseline wedged hepatic venous pressure was measured, followed by measurements at 2, 5, 10 and 15 min after the injection of the drug. Nitrites/nitrates of the hepatic vein were measured before the injection and after 15 min.\nRESULTS: Both agents showed a similar qualitative but a different quantitative haemodynamic profile. No change in the wedged hepatic venous pressure was observed during the first 2 min after the injection of both drugs. This was followed by a decrease: 18% at 5 min (N.S.), 23% at 10 min (P < 0.01) and 24% at 15 min (P < 0.01) for somatostatin. Octreotide induced a relatively smaller decrease in the wedged hepatic venous pressure: 8% at 5 min (N.S.), 20% at 10 min (P < 0.01) and 16% at 15 min (N.S.). Further analysis of the sub-groups of cirrhotic and chronic hepatitis patients revealed a different effect. In the sub-group of cirrhotic patients, somatostatin caused a maximum decrease of 34% at 15 min post-injection (P < 0.01), but octreotide failed to produce a significant change on the wedged hepatic venous pressure.

The potential benefit of remifentanil in these hepatic surgeries remains unknown. The current study investigated whether remifentanil protects the liver against I/R injury in a rat model and whether the underlying mechanism involves the modulation of interleukin (IL)-18 signaling.\nMETHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 45 minutes of partial hepatic ischemia followed by 6 hours of reperfusion. Then, they received an intravenous saline or remifentanil (0.4, 2, or 10 μg/kg per minute) infusion from 30 minutes before ischemia until the end of ischemia with or without previous administration of naloxone, a nonselective opioid receptor antagonist. Serum aminotransferase, hepatic morphology, and hepatic neutrophil infiltration were analyzed. The expression of hepatic IL-18; IL-18-binding protein (BP); and key cytokines downstream of IL-18 signaling were measured.\nRESULTS: Remifentanil significantly decreased serum aminotransferase levels and profoundly attenuated the liver histologic damages. Liver I/R injury increased the expression of both hepatic IL-18 and IL-18BP. Although remifentanil pretreatment significantly decreased I/R-induced IL-18 expression, it further upregulated IL-18BP levels in liver tissues. The I/R-induced increases of hepatic interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α and IL-1β expression, and neutrophil infiltration were also significantly reduced by remifentanil. Naloxone inhibited the remifentanil-induced downregulation of IL-18, but not the elevation of IL-18BP, and significantly attenuated its protective effects on liver I/R injury.\nQuestion: Does remifentanil ameliorate Liver Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury Through Inhibition of Interleukin-18 Signaling?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

In all these cases, the reported mechanism of antiviral inhibition indicates that the pool of IFITM proteins present in target cells blocks incoming viral particles in endosomal vesicles where they are subsequently degraded.\nRESULTS: In this study, we describe an additional mechanism through which IFITMs block HIV-1. In virus-producing cells, IFITMs coalesce with forming virions and are incorporated into viral particles. Expression of IFITMs during virion assembly leads to the production of virion particles of decreased infectivity that are mostly affected during entry in target cells. This mechanism of inhibition is exerted against different retroviruses and does not seem to be dependent on the type of Envelope present on retroviral particles.\nQuestion: Are iFITM proteins incorporated onto HIV-1 virion particles and negatively imprint their infectivity?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

BALB/c mouse with CT26 cells implantation was used as a syngeneic in vivo model for evaluation of treatment and toxicity end points.\nRESULTS: CAPE entered CT26 cells rapidly and depleted intracellular GSH in CT26 cells, but not in bone marrow cells. Pretreatment with nontoxic doses of CAPE significantly enhanced cell killing by ionizing radiation (IR) with sensitizer enhancement ratios up to 2.2. Pretreatment of CT26 cells with N-acetyl-L-cysteine reversed the GSH depletion activity and partially blocked the radiosensitizing effect of CAPE. CAPE treatment in CT26 cells increased glutathione peroxidase, decreased glutathione reductase, and did not affect glutathione S-transferase or gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity.

Vasomotor function was assessed in response to endothelium-dependent agonists using videomicroscopy of small arterioles from fat.\nRESULTS: Arterioles from visceral fat exhibited impaired endothelium-dependent, acetylcholine-mediated vasodilation, compared to the subcutaneous depot (P < 0.001). Expression of mRNA transcripts relevant to the cyclooxygenase pathway was upregulated in visceral compared to subcutaneous fat. Pharmacological inhibition of cyclooxygenase with indomethacin improved endothelium-dependent vasodilator function of arterioles from visceral fat by twofold (P = 0.01), whereas indomethacin had no effect in the subcutaneous depot.

The pathophysiological role of bone marrow-derived microglia is of particular interest because they affect neurodegenerative disorders and neuropathic pain. The hypothesis of the current study is that chronic psychological stress (chronic PS) induces the infiltration of bone marrow-derived microglia into hypothalamus by means of chemokine axes in brain and bone marrow.\nRESULTS: Here we show that bone marrow-derived microglia specifically infiltrate the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of mice that received chronic PS. Bone marrow derived-microglia are CX3CR1(low)CCR2(+)CXCR4(high), as distinct from CX3CR1(high)CCR2(-)CXCR4(low) resident microglia, and express higher levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) but lower levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Chronic PS stimulates the expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in PVN neurons, reduces stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) in the bone marrow and increases the frequency of CXCR4(+) monocytes in peripheral circulation. And then a chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) or a β3-adrenoceptor blockade prevents infiltration of bone marrow-derived microglia in the PVN.\nQuestion: Do bone marrow-derived microglia infiltrate into the paraventricular nucleus of chronic psychological stress-loaded mice?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

Glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (Gli1) is a key mediator of the Hh pathway; however, its expression and clinical significance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) have not been reported. In this study, we aimed to reveal clinical significance of Gli1 expression in ESCC and further investigate the potential of Gli1 as a CSC regulator of ESCC by comparing its expression with expressions of other stemness genes in ESCC.\nMETHODS: We assessed the expressions of Gli1, Sox9, CD44, Sox2, LSD1, and Oct4 in 127 patients' tissue specimens of ESCC using immunohistochemistry and in ESCC cell lines using Western blotting. The relationship of Gli1 expression with clinic-pathologic parameters as well as cell-cycle-regulating genes was investigated. We also investigated the biological pathways that are activated in Gli1-high ESCC using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data.\nRESULTS: Gli1 expression was observed in 28.3 % of ESCC, and its expression was correlated with the expression of stemness genes, Sox9 (P = 0.003) and CD44 (P = 0.012). And Gli1, CD44, and Sox9 were highly expressed in more poorly differentiated ESCC cell lines such as TE8 and TE1 cells. Notably, Gli1 expression was positively associated with distant metastasis (P = 0.011), increased microvessel density (MVD) (P = 0.002), and expression of cell cycle regulators such as p21, cyclin D1, cyclin E1, and NF-κB (P < 0.05). Sox9 and CD44 expressions in ESCC were also significantly associated with unfavorable clinic-pathologic parameters such as increased MVD, advanced tumor (pT) stage, and higher TNM stage. Moreover, all three potential CSC markers such as Gli1, Sox9, and CD44 were strongly linked to worse clinical outcome and independent poor prognostic factors in overall survival and disease-free survival in ESCC.

Because HPV DNA detection has been strongly associated with the presence of a cervical carcinoma precursor (\"squamous intraepithelial lesion,\" or SIL), HPV testing might be useful for identifying women with ASCUS who have an underlying SIL.\nMETHODS: Two hundred specimens demonstrating diverse cervical abnormalities were selected from a prospective population-based study of 9174 women conducted in Costa Rica. The entire cohort had been screened with conventional cervical smears; ThinPrep slides made from liquid buffer, PAPNET, a computerized slide reading system; and Cervicography. Patients with any abnormal screening test were referred for colposcopy, punch biopsy, and loop excision of cases with high grade cytologic abnormalities not explained by punch biopsy. For this investigation, the results of ThinPrep cytology and HPV testing alone and in combination were compared with the final diagnoses, with an emphasis on the detection of carcinoma and high grade SIL.\nRESULTS: The 200 subjects studied included 7 women with a final diagnosis of carcinoma, 44 with high grade SIL, 34 with low grade SIL, 51 with a variety of equivocal diagnoses, and 64 with normal diagnoses. A ThinPrep cytologic diagnosis of SIL or carcinoma was made in 39 (76%) of the 51 women with final diagnoses of high grade SIL or carcinoma.

The fusion protein specifically bound to type I collagen in vitro. In addition, CBD-VEGF promoted human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation after binding to collagen, which indicates that it retained both growth factor activity and collagen-binding ability. When implanted subcutaneously in rats, collagen membranes loaded with CBD-VEGF were significantly vascularized. After it was injected into rats with acute myocardial infarction, CBD-VEGF was largely retained in the cardiac extracellular matrix, in which collagen I was rich. Four weeks after VEGF or CBD-VEGF was injected into the infarct border zone, cardiac function detected by echocardiography and hemodynamics was preserved in the CBD-VEGF group.

In this study, we sought to determine whether inclusion or exclusion of turnover time in comparisons of block utilization would identify different surgical services as under- or overused. For a 13-mo period, we evaluated data extracted from the OR information system of a large academic medical center. During that time period, 15 surgical services performed 12,245 surgical procedures. Allocated block hours, number of first cases performed, total number of cases, and average case durations were determined. The average turnover time for each service was determined by a manual, case-by-case review of data from 1 mo. Raw utilization (RU; case durations only) and adjusted utilization (AU; case duration plus turnover time) were calculated for each service. Turnover time was credited to the service performing surgery after room turnover. Case du-ration was limited to surgeries performed during resource hours. Two indices of utilization (i.e., the usage rate of the service divided by the overall use of all ORs in the suite) were used to compare services: the RU or AU Index (RUI or AUI). Outliers were services with indices that were >1.15 or <0.85. The RUI identified three services as underutilizers and one service as an overutilizer. Using the AUI, the same outliers were identified, and no new services were identified. Examining the changes in index (between AUI and RUI), the percentage of to-follow cases highly correlated with changes in index (r(2) = 0.60); the average turnover time did not (r(2) = 0.002).

The impact of surgical trainees' level of expertise on outcomes after infrainguinal bypass surgery, a technically demanding operation, remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of surgical residents' experience on outcomes after infrainguinal bypass surgery.\nMETHODS: Using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database, we identified patients who underwent infrainguinal bypass from 2005 to 2012. Patients were stratified according to the training level of the most senior operating trainee. Univariate and multivariate analyses, as well as propensity score matched analysis, were performed to compare patient cohorts on operative time, length of hospital stay (LOS), bleeding, early graft failure, unplanned readmission, and 30-day mortality.\nRESULTS: A total of 19,579 patients were identified, of which 35.6% were female and 64.4% were male; mean age was 67.6 years. A PGY1 (postgraduate year) was the highest level trainee operating on 2.5%, a PGY2-4 for 26.2%, and a PGY5+ (postgraduate year 5 or greater) for 37.1%. Attending surgeons operated without trainees on 34.2%. PGY5+s were more likely to operate on patients who were younger, non-White, male, and on dialysis. In multivariable analysis, involvement of any surgical trainee was associated with procedures that took a greater length of time, had a greater odds of blood transfusion, and necessitated a longer hospital LOS relative to procedures performed by an attending surgeon alone. Only bypasses wherein PGY5+s were involved were associated with greater odds of early graft failure, unplanned readmission, and 30-day mortality when compared with procedures done without trainee involvement. After excluding lower extremity bypasses in which an attending surgeon operated without a trainee, propensity score matching analysis showed that patients operated on by PGY5+s had longer operative time (4.11 vs. 3.96 hr, P < 0.0001) and greater rates of postoperative bleeding (9.77% vs. 8.15%, P = 0.004) relative to patients operated on by attendings assisted by PGY1-4s, but no statistically significant difference in LOS, early graft failure, unplanned readmission, and perioperative mortality.\nQuestion: Is operative Autonomy among Senior Surgical Trainees during Infrainguinal Bypass Operations Associated with Worse Long-term Patient Outcomes?", "answer": "No", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

The aims of this study were: first, to evaluate the tissue specificity of defense gene expression in the model mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea and, second, to assess the degree of conservation in transcriptional regulation during sexual development in basidiomycetes.\nRESULTS: In order to characterize the regulation in the expression of defense loci and the transcriptional circuitries controlling sexual reproduction in basidiomycetes, we sequenced the poly (A)-positive transcriptome of stage 1 primordia and vegetative mycelium of C. cinerea A43mutB43mut. Our data show that many genes encoding predicted and already characterized defense proteins are differentially expressed in these tissues. The predicted specificity of these proteins with regard to target organisms suggests that their expression pattern correlates with the type of antagonists these tissues are confronted with. Accordingly, we show that the stage 1 primordium-specific protein CC1G_11805 is toxic to insects and nematodes. Comparison of our data to analogous data from Laccaria bicolor and Schizophyllum commune revealed that the transcriptional regulation of nearly 70 loci is conserved and probably subjected to stabilizing selection.

Among these genes, basic fibroblast growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor were identified by immunochemical methods as proteins that are specifically expressed at high levels in thyroid neoplasms. Basic fibroblast growth factor, which has been identified as a biomarker for PTC, was overexpressed in 54% of PTC cases, 67% of follicular thyroid carcinomas, and 36% of benign thyroid neoplasms. Platelet-derived growth factor was overexpressed in 81% of PTC cases and 100% of follicular carcinomas, but was immunonegative in normal thyroid tissues and benign thyroid neoplasms.\nQuestion: Does gene expression profiling identify platelet-derived growth factor as a diagnostic molecular marker for papillary thyroid carcinoma?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

The relevant intracellular apoptotic pathways, however, are unknown. XIAP is an antiapoptotic protein that both inhibits caspases and reciprocally regulates the proapoptotic Smac/Omi proteins. AAV-mediated delivery of various XIAP mutants could distinguish between these antiapoptotic pathways in the ear and further the development of specific reagents for gene therapy- mediated prevention of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity.\nMETHODS: We administered unilaterally through the round-window AAV-harboring genes encoding wild-type dXIAP, yellow fluorescent protein, or either of two dXIAP point mutants-one deficient in caspase inhibition (dXIAP-d) and the other additionally deficient in the binding of Smac/Omi (dXIAP-t). All rats received a 3-day systemic course of cisplatin. Functional hearing loss was measured by shifts in auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds after cisplatin treatment, and hair-cell loss was assessed by whole-mount phalloidin staining of cochlear turns.\nRESULTS: Uninjected ears universally displayed high-frequency-specific hair-cell loss and ABR threshold shifts upon cisplatin treatment. Although yellow fluorescent protein had no effect, ears injected with dXIAP exhibited 68% less ABR threshold shift at 32 kHz and 50% less basal-turn outer-hair-cell loss compared with contralateral untreated ears. This protection was maintained in ears injected with dXIAP-d but was abolished in those expressing dXIAP-t, which is incapable of blocking Smac/Omi.\nQuestion: Is protection against cisplatin-induced ototoxicity by adeno-associated virus-mediated delivery of the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein dependent on caspase inhibition?", "answer": "No", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

EPOM results in a clear correspondence map of biological samples from different tissue and cell types through comparison of epigenomic marks evaluated in their relevant chromatin states.\nRESULTS: Correspondence maps by EPOM show strong capability in distinguishing and grouping different tissue and cell types and reveal biologically meaningful similarities between Heart and Muscle, Blood & T-cell and HSC & B-cell, Brain and Neurosphere, etc. The gene ontology enrichment analysis both supports and explains the discoveries made by EPOM and suggests that the associated enhancers and promoters demonstrate distinguishable functions across tissue and cell types.

Electrophysiological studies indicate that phencyclidine (PCP) markedly disrupts neuronal activity with an overall excitatory effect and reduces the power of low-frequency oscillations (LFO; <4 Hz) in thalamocortical networks. Because the reticular nucleus of the thalamus (RtN) provides tonic feed-forward inhibition to the rest of the thalamic nuclei, we examined the effect of PCP on RtN activity, under the working hypothesis that NMDA-R blockade in RtN would disinhibit thalamocortical networks.\nMETHODS: Drug effects (PCP followed by clozapine) on the activity of RtN (single unit and local field potential recordings) and prefrontal cortex (PFC; electrocorticogram) in anesthetized rats were assessed.\nRESULTS: PCP (.25-.5 mg/kg, intravenous) reduced the discharge rate of 19 of 21 RtN neurons to 37% of baseline (p < .000001) and the power of LFO in RtN and PFC to ~20% of baseline (p < .001). PCP also reduced the coherence between PFC and RtN in the LFO range. A low clozapine dose (1 mg/kg intravenous) significantly countered the effect of PCP on LFO in PFC but not in RtN and further reduced the discharge rate of RtN neurons.

Beyond 5-6 months of age, transgenic mice developed a systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like syndrome, with numerous features of the disease. They produced autoantibodies against double-stranded DNA. Their kidneys showed pathologic changes indicative of glomerular nephritis and IgG and C3 deposition, and proteinuria, leukocyturia, and hematuria, were evident.

After inhibiting protein synthesis using cycloheximide (CHX), we found that levels of both megalin and ClC5 were lower in Cd-challenged cells than in cells treated with Cd or CHX only, which is consistent with reduced translation and/or posttranslational down-regulation. Moreover, Cd-induced degradation of megalin and ClC5 was abolished by the lysosomal pathway inhibitor bafilomycin A-1 but not by the proteasome system blocker MG-132, suggesting that the enhanced proteolysis was occurring via lysosomes.

The purpose of this study was to ascertain whether a difference in intracellular signaling molecules could explain the hyperreleasable phenotype of human IgE(+) basophils.\nMETHODS: Basophils were purified by means of double Percoll gradients and negative selection with magnetic beads.

The aim of this isolated heart study was to compare protective effects of halothane and low CaCl2 (0.5 mM) administered during 1 day of hypothermic perfusion on return of normothermic perfusion.\nMETHODS: Guinea pig hearts (n = 66) were isolated and perfused at 37 degrees C with a Krebs' solution, gassed with 96% O2, 4% CO2, and containing 2.5 mM Ca2+, and 4.5 mM K+. Heart rate, isovolumetric left ventricular pressure, coronary flow, %O2 extraction, O2 consumption rate, and relative cardiac efficiency (EFF = heart rate.left ventricular pressure/O2 consumption rate) were measured in five groups of hearts: time controls (no hypothermia); 1.5, and 3% halothane delivered by vaporizer; cold controls (hypothermia only); and 0.5 mM CaCl2.

The condition is characterized histologically by concentric layers of fibrosis around small-caliber arteries and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate dominated by eosinophils. After the serendipitous observation of an elevated serum concentration of IgG4 in 1 patient with EAF, we investigated the hypothesis that EAF is an IgG4-related systemic disease.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively identified 5 EAF cases from our files. Demographic, clinical, and serological data were reviewed, and the histologic features and tissue IgG4 staining patterns were examined on biopsies from each case.\nRESULTS: Patients (2 male, 3 female) ranged in age from 31 to 82 years (mean, 56 y). The extent of disease varied from isolated involvement of the nasal cavity or the lacrimal gland to multicentric disease affecting the sinuses, nasal tract, and lower respiratory tract. The duration of symptoms ranged from 6 months to >20 years. The demographic features of the patients and disease extent were consistent with previously published reports of EAF, except for involvement of the lower respiratory tract in 1 case. Four of the 5 cases showed concentric perivascular fibrosis surrounding small-caliber vascular channels, embedded in an inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils. One lacrimal gland biopsy showed a periductal inflammatory infiltrate, and 2 cases showed a storiform pattern of fibrosis. The index case had a serum IgG4 concentration of 1490 mg/dL (normal, 8 to 140 mg/dL). IgG4-positive plasma cells were identified in biopsies from 4 of the 5 cases. The numbers of IgG4-positive plasma cells ranged from 43 to 118 per high-power field, and the IgG4:IgG ratios ranged from 0.68 to 0.97.

Only 32% identified obesity among CCR risk factors. For 57% of participants, their own current BMI status did not confer any increased risk for CRC. Also, for half (46%) of the patients, their BMI status will not lead to an increased risk during lifetime. For 36%, an increased risk was accurately estimated as two or more. Accurate estimates tend to be made by older patients (p = 0.033), those with GI complaints (p = 0.040), or with familial history (p = 0.016).

Prolonged disuse also leads to relevant neural adaptations; however, its effects on BLD are still unknown. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a 35-day bed rest on the BLD of the lower limbs.\nMETHODS: Ten young healthy volunteers performed maximal explosive efforts on a sledge ergometer with both lower limbs or with the right and the left limb separately.

When RMPI medium was used, no reduction in response to bradykinin was observed at 25 mM glucose, but a significant reduction in [Ca2+i] signal was observed after exposure to 35 mM glucose for a similar time period. Defective [Ca2+i] signaling was also seen in cells using MEM medium.

The defect in [Ca2+i] signal was not mimicked by either mannose or sucrose, but was prevented by co-incubation with cytochalasin B to inhibit glucose uptake. Neither superoxide dismutase nor catalase nor the extracellular hydroxyl radical scavenger, mannitol, blocked the reduction in the bradykinin-induced increase of [Ca2+i] in elevated glucose-exposed cells; however, the reduction was completely blocked by the cell-permeable hydroxyl radical scavenger, dimethylthiourea.

Through comparative genomics, phenomics and mutant construction we previously suggested possible mechanistic reasons why these serovars demonstrate apparently distinct host ranges. Here, we investigate the genetic and phenotypic diversity of these two serovars in the UK. We produce a phylogenetic reconstruction and perform several biochemical assays on isolates of S. Derby and S. Mbandaka acquired from sites across the UK between the years 2000 and 2010.\nRESULTS: We show that UK isolates of S. Mbandaka comprise of one clonal lineage which is adapted to proficient utilisation of metabolites found in soya beans under ambient conditions. We also show that this clonal lineage forms a biofilm at 25 °C, suggesting that this serovar maybe well adapted to survival ex vivo, growing in animal feed. Conversely, we show that S.

They are used as biocatalysts in acrylamide production, one of the few commercial scale bioprocesses, as well as in environmental remediation for the removal of nitriles from waste streams. Nitrile hydratases are composed of two subunits, alpha and beta, and they contain one iron atom per alphabeta unit. We have determined the crystal structure of photoactivated iron-containing nitrile hydratase from Rhodococcus sp. R312 to 2.65 A resolution as a first step in the elucidation of its catalytic mechanism.\nRESULTS: The alpha subunit consists of a long N-terminal arm and a C-terminal domain that forms a novel fold. This fold can be described as a four layered structure, alpha-beta-beta-alpha, with unusual connectivities between the beta strands. The beta subunit also contains a long N-terminal extension, a helical domain, and a C-terminal domain that folds into a beta roll. The two subunits form a tight heterodimer that is the functional unit of the enzyme. The active site is located in a cavity at the subunit-subunit interface.

The choriodecidua produces relaxin (RLN) and elevated levels are associated with preterm premature rupture of the fetal membranes. However, it is not increased in bacterially-mediated PTB, but may act as an endogenous sterile inflammatory mediator. Elevated systemic RLN levels from the corpus luteum are also associated with PTB, but the mechanism is unknown. In clinical obstetrics, intrauterine inflammation or infection can coexist with elevated RLN. Therefore, in this study, we further characterized the effects of RLN alone or together with an inflammatory mediator on the production of IL1B, CSF2 (GM-CSF), IL6, IL8 and TNF, from chorionic cytotrophoblasts (CyT), decidual fibroblasts (DF) and stromal cells (DSC), using interleukin-1 beta (IL1B) to mimic sterile inflammation or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for bacterial infection. Endogenous differences between the cells showed that the CyT expressed more RLN, its receptor RXFP1 and the RXFP1 splice variant D. CyT also showed the most robust cAMP response to RLN with increased IL6 secreted after 4 h, preceded by increased transcription at 1 h, likely due to activation of RXFP1 and cAMP. When all cell types were treated with IL1B and RLN, RLN augmented secretion of IL6 and IL8 from CyT and DF, but not DSC. Similarly, RLN augmented LPS-induced IL6 secretion from CyT and DF. Despite the structural similarity between TLR4 and RXFP1, blocking TLR4 in CyT had no effect on RLN-induced IL6 secretion, suggesting specific activation of RXFP1. Thus, we have shown that in the presence of a low level of intrauterine inflammation/infection, elevated RLN could act on the CyT and DF to augment the inflammatory response, contributing to the pathophysiology of PTB.\nQuestion: Does relaxin augment the inflammatory IL6 response in the choriodecidua?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

NF-κB up-regulates pro-inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-α, cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) and ICAM-1, and promotes macrophage infiltration into renal tissue, further inducing the progression of LN. Over the past 30 years, research has demonstrated that Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (TWHF) possesses potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities, and that demethylzeylasteral (T-96), an extract of TWHF, may be one of the responsible compounds.

Also, eight WT C57BL/6 mice were used as normal control. After treatment by gavage with 0.10 ml/10 g/day volumes for 8 weeks, all mice were sacrificed and renal tissues were collected.

The time-reaction curves were analysed determining their gradient (T1) and their onset (T2) as well as the half effect time (HET).\nRESULTS: Phagocytes from patients with XLA showed a significantly accelerated basal phagocytosis (reduction of HET by 24% p < 0.001) compared to healthy controls. After incubation with B/T (10 microg/ml each) speed of phagocytosis was nearly doubled (phagocyte activity p < 0.0001, Candida uptake p < 0.003), T2 of respiratory burst was reduced by 65 % (p < 0.0001) and killing was accelerated by 27% (p < 0.046). However, the maximal activities of all kinetics were not altered. Incubation of phagocytes from healthy controls with B/T accelerated phagocytosis to a level comparable to that of untreated phagocytes from patients with XLA and also accelerated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (reduction of HET by 28%, p < 0.012). In contrast to phagocytes from patients with XLA, phagocytes of patients with CVID showed a similar stimulation by B/T like healthy controls.

Using DD-PCR, we identified a downregulated cDNA-fragment in these prostate cancer cells. This fragment (N7) was cloned and further analyzed by CMRT-PCR, Northern-blot analysis, and in situ hybridization.\nRESULTS: Sequence analysis revealed that N7 is identical to the 3'-untranslated region of the recently described immediate early gene Cyr61. Comparative multiplex RT-PCR with sequence specific primers showed that Cyr61 is downregulated in the tumor tissue of 7 out of 13 patients. By in situ hybridization we could demonstrate that the expression of Cyr61 is restricted to the epithelium of the prostate.

In flowering plants, two main groups of α-DOXs have been described. While the α-DOX1 isoforms are mainly involved in defense responses against microbial infection and herbivores, the α-DOX2 isoforms are mostly related to development. To gain insight into the roles played by these enzymes during land plant evolution, we performed biochemical, genetic and molecular analyses to examine the function of the single copy moss Physcomitrella patens α-DOX (Ppα-DOX) in development and defense against pathogens.\nRESULTS: Recombinant Ppα-DOX protein catalyzed the conversion of fatty acids into 2-hydroperoxy derivatives with a substrate preference for α-linolenic, linoleic and palmitic acids. Ppα-DOX is expressed during development in tips of young protonemal filaments with maximum expression levels in mitotically active undifferentiated apical cells. In leafy gametophores, Ppα-DOX is expressed in auxin producing tissues, including rhizoid and axillary hairs. Ppα-DOX transcript levels and Ppα-DOX activity increased in moss tissues infected with Botrytis cinerea or treated with Pectobacterium carotovorum elicitors. In B. cinerea infected leaves, Ppα-DOX-GUS proteins accumulated in cells surrounding infected cells, suggesting a protective mechanism. Targeted disruption of Ppα-DOX did not cause a visible developmental alteration and did not compromise the defense response. However, overexpressing Ppα-DOX, or incubating wild-type tissues with Ppα-DOX-derived oxylipins, principally the aldehyde heptadecatrienal, resulted in smaller moss colonies with less protonemal tissues, due to a reduction of caulonemal filament growth and a reduction of chloronemal cell size compared with normal tissues. In addition, Ppα-DOX overexpression and treatments with Ppα-DOX-derived oxylipins reduced cellular damage caused by elicitors of P. carotovorum.\nQuestion: Does the Physcomitrella patens unique alpha-dioxygenase participate in both developmental processes and defense responses?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are the main effectors of liver fibrosis. TGFβ, produced by HCV-specific CD8(+) T cells, is a key regulatory cytokine modulating HCV-specific effector T cells. Here we studied TGFβ as well as other factors produced by HCV-specific intrahepatic lymphocytes (IHL) and peripheral blood cells in hepatic inflammation and fibrogenesis. This was a cross-sectional study of two well-defined groups of HCV-infected subjects with slow (≤ 0.1 Metavir units/year, n = 13) or rapid (n = 6) liver fibrosis progression. HCV-specific T-cell responses were studied using interferon-gamma (IFNγ)-ELISpot ±monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) blocking regulatory cytokines, along with multiplex, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and multiparameter fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). The effects of IHL stimulated with HCV-core peptides on HSC expression of profibrotic and fibrolytic genes were determined. Blocking regulatory cytokines significantly raised detection of HCV-specific effector (IFNγ) responses only in slow fibrosis progressors, both in the periphery (P = 0.003) and liver (P = 0.01). Regulatory cytokine blockade revealed HCV-specific IFNγ responses strongly correlated with HCV-specific TGFβ, measured before blockade (R = 0.84, P = 0.0003), with only a trend to correlation with HCV-specific IL-10. HCV-specific TGFβ was produced by CD8 and CD4 T cells. HCV-specific TGFβ, not interleukin (IL)-10, inversely correlated with liver inflammation (R = -0.63, P = 0.008) and, unexpectedly, fibrosis (R = -0.46, P = 0.05).

VEGF blockade was found to counteract cell mobilization.

Response to anti-TNF therapy was determined up to 24 months following anti-TNF initiation by concomitant corticosteroid use, CD surgery, anti-TNF dose escalation, and anti-TNF discontinuation/switch. A top-down approach to anti-TNF therapy was associated with a lower risk of concomitant corticosteroid use, anti-TNF dose escalation, discontinuation/switch of anti-TNF, and CD-related surgery compared with the step-up and IS-to-TNF therapy approaches.\nQuestion: Is response to biologic therapy in Crohn 's disease improved with early treatment : an analysis of health claims data?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

This has been exploited in combined auxiliary liver-kidney transplantation, where a renal graft is transplanted against a positive crossmatch under the protection of a liver transplanted from the same donor.\nMETHODS: To elucidate mechanisms behind the liver protective effect, we studied early transcriptional changes of inflammatory mediators in the grafts during combined auxiliary liver-kidney transplantation using microarrays and real-time polymerase chain reaction. The results were correlated to clinical data.\nRESULTS: Liver and kidney grafts both exhibited an upregulation of the leukocyte-recruiting chemokines CCL2, CCL3, and CCL4. Notably, liver grafts strongly upregulated CCL20, a dendritic cell, and T-cell recruiting chemokine. By comparing the gene expression in liver grafts with the clinical outcome, we found that 14 of 45 investigated inflammatory genes were expressed significantly higher in patients without early rejection when compared with those with early rejections.

We investigated the effect of SM22 deficiency in a mouse artery injury model to determine the role of SM22 in arterial chondrogenesis.\nRESULTS: Sm22 knockout (Sm22(-/-)) mice developed prominent medial chondrogenesis 2 weeks after carotid denudation as evidenced by the enhanced expression of chondrogenic markers including type II collagen, aggrecan, osteopontin, bone morphogenetic protein 2, and SRY-box containing gene 9 (SOX9). This was concomitant with suppression of VSMC key transcription factor myocardin and of VSMC markers such as SM α-actin and myosin heavy chain. The conversion tendency from myogenesis to chondrogenesis was also observed in primary Sm22(-/-) VSMCs and in a VSMC line after Sm22 knockdown: SM22 deficiency altered VSMC morphology with compromised stress fibre formation and increased actin dynamics. Meanwhile, the expression level of Sox9 mRNA was up-regulated while the mRNA levels of myocardin and VSMC markers were down-regulated, indicating a pro-chondrogenic transcriptional switch in SM22-deficient VSMCs.

Transient over expression of the tumor suppressor gene APC in colon cancer cells prevents entry into S phase of the cell cycle, a phenotype only partially restored by cotransfection of a transcriptionally active form of beta-catenin. In an attempt to define its transcription-independent tumor suppressor functions, we tested whether APC directly affects DNA replication.\nMETHODS: A transcriptionally quiescent in vitro DNA replication system, the polymerase chain reaction, DNA binding assays, and transient transfections in colon cancer cell lines were used to determine the effects of APC on DNA replication and the mechanism by which it works.\nRESULTS: We report that exogenous full-length APC inhibits replication of template DNA through a function that maps to amino acids 2140-2421, a region of the protein commonly lost by somatic or germline mutation. This segment of APC directly interacts with DNA, while mutation of the DNA-binding S(T)PXX motifs within it abolishes DNA binding and reduces inhibition of DNA replication.

A single urologic pathologist (J.C.C.) reviewed all of the microscopic slides without knowledge of patient outcome. Cystic clear cell RCC was characterized by numerous confluent cysts lined by clear cells, and containing nests of clear cells within the cyst walls.\nRESULTS: There were 85 (3.5%) patients with cystic RCC.

The effect of cytokine or asthma medication on histamine or bradykinin induced IPx signalling was assessed by [3H] inositol incorporation. Quantitative Real Time PCR was used to measure mRNA levels of receptors and downstream signalling components. Transcriptional mechanisms were explored using a combination of 5'Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (5'RACE) and promoter-reporter techniques.\nRESULTS: Treatment of Human ASM cells with IL-13, IFN gamma or salmeterol for 24 hours lead to a modest augmentation of histamine induced IPx responses (144.3 +/- 9.3, 126.4 +/- 7.5 and 117.7 +/- 5.2%, p < 0.05).

Levels of anxiety and depression were assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A and HADS-D, respectively). Self-reported information on various work-related factors, demographics, lifestyle and somatic health problems was included. The main analytical methods were univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA)/Kruskal-Wallis test, chi(2)/Fisher's exact test and logistic regression.\nRESULTS: Compared with non-farmers, farmers had higher levels and prevalences of depression, particularly the male farmers, who also had higher anxiety levels. Among men, farmers reported longer work hours, lower income, higher psychological job demands and less decision latitude compared with non-farmers. Farmers had physically heavier work and a lower level of education than non-farmers. Generally, the differences were largest between full-time farmers and non-farmers.

Analysis of serum autoantibodies to tumor antigens combined with gene expression profiling of primary tumors may provide insight into the mechanisms underlying lung carcinogenesis and identify new AD biomarkers.\nMETHODS: T7 phage cDNA libraries were used to identify AZGP1 autoantibodies in the serum of 473 patients (192 ADs, 192 matched controls, and 89 additional ADs for confirmation of findings). AZGP1 mRNA expression was examined in 86 ADs and 10 control lung tissue samples using oligonucleotide microarrays. AZGP1 protein expression was studied in 230 tissue samples (222 ADs; 8 controls) with immunohistochemistry. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to correlate circulating autoantibody and tissue mRNA production with survival.

Whereas MAPK is a well-known effector pathway of KRAS, blocking this pathway with clinically available MAPK inhibitors is relatively ineffective. Here, we report that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition rewires the expression of receptor tyrosine kinases, leading to differential feedback activation of the MAPK pathway following MEK inhibition. In epithelial-like KRAS-mutant lung cancers, this feedback was attributed to ERBB3-mediated activation of MEK and AKT. In contrast, in mesenchymal-like KRAS-mutant lung cancers, FGFR1 was dominantly expressed but suppressed by the negative regulator Sprouty proteins; MEK inhibition led to repression of SPRY4 and subsequent FGFR1-mediated reactivation of MEK and AKT. Therapeutically, the combination of a MEK inhibitor (MEKi) and an FGFR inhibitor (FGFRi) induced cell death in vitro and tumor regressions in vivo These data establish the rationale and a therapeutic approach to treat mesenchymal-like KRAS-mutant lung cancers effectively with clinically available FGFR1 and MAPK inhibitors.\nQuestion: Does epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition define Feedback Activation of Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Signaling Induced by MEK Inhibition in KRAS-Mutant Lung Cancer?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

A variety of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria produce large quantities of indole that functions as an intercellular signal controlling diverse aspects of bacterial physiology.\nRESULTS: In this study, we sought a novel role of indole in a gram-positive bacteria Paenibacillus alvei that can produce extracellular indole at a concentration of up to 300 μM in the stationary phase in Luria-Bertani medium. Unlike previous studies, our data show that the production of indole in P. alvei is strictly controlled by catabolite repression since the addition of glucose and glycerol completely turns off the indole production. The addition of exogenous indole markedly inhibits the heat resistance of P. alvei without affecting cell growth. Observation of cell morphology with electron microscopy shows that indole inhibits the development of spore coats and cortex in P. alvei. As a result of the immature spore formation of P. alvei, indole also decreases P. alvei survival when exposed to antibiotics, low pH, and ethanol. Additionally, indole derivatives also influence the heat resistance; for example, a plant auxin, 3-indolylacetonitrile dramatically (2900-fold) decreased the heat resistance of P. alvei, while another auxin 3-indoleacetic acid had a less significant influence on the heat resistance of P. alvei.\nQuestion: Do indole and 3-indolylacetonitrile inhibit spore maturation in Paenibacillus alvei?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

Logistic regression analysis was used to assess associations between duration and intensity of the GP-patient relationship and use of specialist care. Analyses were adjusted for sex, age, marital status, income, education, and self-rated health, and also stratified by self-rated health and age.\nRESULTS: Of 10,624 eligible GP users, 85% had seen the same GP for >2 years. The probability of visiting outpatient specialist services was significantly lower among these participants compared to those with a shorter GP relationship (odds ratio [OR] = 0.81, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.71 to 0.92). Similar findings were found for hospitalisations (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.64 to 0.90). Stratified analyses revealed that these associations were not dependent on self-rated health or age.

Simultaneous to blood sampling, aliquots of the albumin dialysate were taken between the elements of the dialysate circuit.\nRESULTS: Fischer's Index in systemic blood increased during MARS by 24% (from 1.44 to 1.79, P < 0.001; mean treatment duration, 5.5 h). Systemic tryptophan level was significantly reduced at the same time (-25%, n = 8). Amino acid removal rates from plasma during a single dialyser passage ranged from 10 to 53%. In particular, AAA were preferentially removed (42-44% throughout treatment), while BCAA removal was 28-46% initially and later declined to 24-28%. A maximum concentration gradient between plasma and dialysate was maintained for the AAA throughout treatment through their apparently complete removal by the charcoal adsorber.

We hence tried to explore the effect of EPO in regulating ZnT8 and protecting retinal cells in diabetic rats and possible mechanisms.\nMETHODS: Diabetes was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats. Intravitreal injection of EPO was performed 1 month after diabetes onset. The CoCl2-treated rat Müller cell line (rMC-1) was cotreated with EPO, soluble EPO receptor (sEPOR), digoxin, or U0126. Cell viability, cell death, and intracellular zinc level were examined. The expression of ZnT8, HIF-1α, AKT, and ERK was studied.\nRESULTS: In diabetic rat retinas, EPO significantly decreased HIF-1α expression and increased ZnT8 expression. In CoCl2-treated rMC-1 cells, EPO increased cell viability and decreased intracellular zinc. Erythropoietin or digoxin could activate ERK pathway, downregulate HIF-1α, and upregulate ZnT8.

Apoptosis was triggered by the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin (CPT). Activation of caspases in situ using the fluorochrome-labeled inhibitor (FLICA) method and determination of plasma membrane integrity by excluding propidium iodide (PI) were measured by both laser scanning cytometry (LSC) and flow cytometry (FC). LSC and FC identified cells at three sequential stages of their demise: early apoptosis (cells with activated caspases and PI negative); late apoptosis (cells with activated caspases but unable to exclude PI); secondary necrosis (cells with apoptotic morphology no longer stained with FLICA, not excluding PI).\nRESULTS: MF alone did not induce any apoptogenic or necrogenic effect. CPT exposure led to the sequential appearance of apoptotic cells. In the presence of CPT and MF, the overall proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis was not significantly changed.

DRPs identified were categorized according to the Pharmaceutical Care Network of Europe DRP classification system.\nRESULTS: In 56 medication reviews conducted, a total of 173 DRPs were identified with an average of 3.3 DRPs per patient. The most commonly encountered DRPs were non-adherence (31 %), need for education (23 %), and adverse drug reactions (21 %). Patients receiving six or more medications had significantly higher number of DRPs compared to those receiving three medications (p ≤ 0.05). Furthermore, elderly patients tended to have more DRPs compared to younger patients and there was a linear relationship between age and DRPs.\nQuestion: Does drug-related problems identified by pharmacists conducting medication use review at a primary health center in Qatar?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of miR-155 drives an increased mutation frequency both in vitro and in vivo, promoting genomic instability by affecting multiple DNA repair pathways. miR-155 overexpression causes a decrease in homologous recombination, but yields a concurrent increase in the error-prone nonhomologous end-joining pathway. Despite repressing established targets MLH1 and MSH6, the identified mutation pattern upon miR-155 overexpression does not resemble that of a mismatch repair-deficient background. Further investigation revealed that all four subunits of polymerase delta, a high-fidelity DNA replication, and repair polymerase are downregulated at the mRNA level in the context of miR-155 overexpression. FOXO3a, a transcription factor and known target of miR-155, has one or more putative binding site(s) in the promoter of all four polymerase delta subunits. Finally, suppression of FOXO3a by miR-155 or by siRNA knockdown is sufficient to repress the expression of the catalytic subunit of polymerase delta, POLD1, at the protein level, indicating that FOXO3a contributes to the regulation of polymerase delta levels.\nQuestion: Does miR-155 Overexpression promote Genomic Instability by Reducing High-fidelity Polymerase Delta Expression and Activating Error-Prone DSB Repair?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

Movies of blinking fluorophores were reconstructed to generate subdiffraction images at ∼20 nm resolution. With this method, we characterized clusters of connexin43 (Cx43) and of 'the desmosomal protein' plakophilin-2 (PKP2). In about half of Cx43 clusters, we observed overlay of Cx43 and PKP2 at the Cx43 plaque edge. SiRNA-mediated loss of Ankyrin-G expression yielded larger Cx43 clusters, of less regular shape, and larger Cx43-PKP2 subdomains.

At present, PAP is treated by whole lung lavage or with granulocyte/monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF); however, the effectiveness of GM-CSF in treating LPI associated PAP is uncertain. We hypothesized that GM-CSF and surfactant protein D (SP-D) would enhance the clearance of proteins and dying cells that are typically present in the airways of PAP lungs.\nMETHODS: Cells and cell-free supernatant of therapeutic bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of a two-year-old patient with LPI were isolated on multiple occasions. Diagnostic BALF samples from an age-matched patient with bronchitis or adult PAP patients were used as controls. SP-D and total protein content of the supernatants were determined by BCA assays and Western blots, respectively. Cholesterol content was determined by a calorimetic assay or Oil Red O staining of cytospin preparations. The cells and surfactant lipids were also analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. Uptake of Alexa-647 conjugated BSA and DiI-labelled apoptotic Jurkat T-cells by BAL cells were studied separately in the presence or absence of SP-D (1 microg/ml) and/or GM-CSF (10 ng/ml), ex vivo. Specimens were analyzed by light and fluorescence microscopy.\nRESULTS: Here we show that large amounts of cholesterol, and large numbers of cholesterol crystals, dying cells, and lipid-laden foamy alveolar macrophages were present in the airways of the LPI patient. Although SP-D is present, its bioavailability is low in the airways. SP-D was partially degraded and entrapped in the unusual surfactant lipid tubules with circular lattice, in vivo. We also show that supplementing SP-D and GM-CSF increases the uptake of protein and dying cells by healthy LPI alveolar macrophages, ex vivo.

In the case-control study (1003 patients with CHD, 1003 matched control subjects), Hsp60 levels were higher in patients with CHD and were related to CHD (OR comparing extreme quartiles=4.14, P<0.0001).

In separate in vitro studies, the CYP3A-mediated formation of 1'-hydroxymidazolam by human hepatic and intestinal microsomes was investigated.\nRESULTS: No gender-related differences were noted in either the systemic (370 +/- 114 ml/min [mean +/- SD]) or oral (1413 +/- 807 ml/min) clearance values of midazolam. Despite complete oral absorption, measured oral bioavailability was on average about 50% less than that predicted on the assumption that only the liver contributed to first-pass metabolism.

Its secretion in the extracellular matrix makes TFPI-2 a potential inhibitor of tumor cell invasion. However, no studies have yet evaluated the wound-healing activities of human Tenon's capsule fibroblasts (hTCFs). The aim of the study is to elucidate the effect of TFPI-2 overexpression on hTCF proliferation and migration, to determine whether TFPI-2 may act as an antiscarring agent in vivo after glaucoma filtration surgery.\nMETHODS: Plasmid vector pBos-Cite-neo/TFPI-2 was transfected into hTCFs with Lipofectamine 2000. After selection by G418, transfected, non-transfected, and mock-transfected cells were screened for TFPI-2 mRNA and protein by reverse transcription-PCR and western blot analysis respectively. Cell proliferation and viability were determined by 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometry. Cell migration was studied on restrained collagen gels and with a scratch-wound assay.\nRESULTS: TFPI-2 expression of mRNA and protein was confirmed in transfected cells. The transfected, non-transfected, and mock-transfected cells showed no significant difference in cell proliferation and apoptosis, with TFPI-2 found not to be cytotoxic in hTCFs.

Tumor blood vessel formation and remodeling is a complex and multi-step processes. The differentiation and recruitment of mural cells including vascular smooth muscle cells and pericytes are essential steps in tumor angiogenesis. However, the role of tumor cells in differentiation and recruitment of mural cells has not yet been fully elucidated. This study focuses on the role of human tumor cells in governing the differentiation of mouse mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to pericytes and their recruitment in the tumor angiogenesis process.\nRESULTS: We show that C3H/10T1/2 mouse embryonic mesenchymal stem cells, under the influence of different tumor cell-derived conditioned media, differentiate into mature pericytes. These differentiated pericytes, in turn, are recruited to bind with capillary-like networks formed by endothelial cells on the matrigel under in vitro conditions and recruited to bind with blood vessels on gel-foam under in vivo conditions. The degree of recruitment of pericytes into in vitro neo-angiogenesis is tumor cell phenotype specific. Interestingly, invasive cells recruit less pericytes as compared to non-invasive cells.

However, it remains unclear whether such an effect can be elicited at later embryonic or postnatal stages, which has important implications in mouse HC regeneration by reactivation of Notch1 signaling.\nRESULTS: We performed comprehensive in vivo inducible overactivation of NICD at various developmental stages.

Preparation and life completion interventions have shown positive results in the existential/spiritual care of hospice-eligible patients in the United States. Nurses are in the ideal position to deliver such interventions, but have not been previously evaluated in this context.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to explore the acceptability and feasibility of a nurse-facilitated preparation and life completion intervention (Outlook) in an Australian palliative care patient population.\nMETHODS: Patients discussed their life story, forgiveness, and heritage and legacy over 3 audiotaped sessions. Preintervention/postintervention outcome measures included the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Spirituality Well-being, Profile of Mood States, Quality of Life at End of Life Scale, and Center for Epidemiological Depression Scale. Participant feedback was subjected to thematic analysis to understand the patient experience of receiving the intervention.\nRESULTS: Ten palliative care patients with advanced cancer completed the study.

This is the first prospective study to report the association between commonly reported sleep symptoms and the development of the metabolic syndrome, a key CVD risk factor.\nMETHODS: Participants were from the community-based Heart Strategies Concentrating on Risk Evaluation study. The sample was comprised of 812 participants (36% African American; 67% female) who were free of metabolic syndrome at baseline, had completed a baseline sleep questionnaire, and had metabolic syndrome evaluated 3 years after baseline. Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) was measured cross-sectionally using a portable monitor in a subset of 290 participants. Logistic regression examined the risk of developing metabolic syndrome and its components according to individual sleep symptoms and insomnia syndrome.\nRESULTS: Specific symptoms of insomnia (difficulty falling asleep [DFA] and \"unrefreshing\" sleep), but not a syndromal definition of insomnia, were significant predictors of the development of metabolic syndrome. Loud snoring more than doubled the risk of developing the metabolic syndrome and also predicted specific metabolic abnormalities (hyperglycemia and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). With further adjustment for AHI or the number of metabolic abnormalities at baseline, loud snoring remained a significant predictor of metabolic syndrome, whereas DFA and unrefreshing sleep were reduced to marginal significance.\nQuestion: Do sleep symptoms predict the development of the metabolic syndrome?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

HTLV-1 contains both regulatory and accessory genes in four pX open reading frames. pX ORF-II encodes two proteins, p13 and p30, whose roles are still being defined in the virus life cycle and in HTLV-1 virus-host cell interactions. Proviral clones of HTLV-1 with pX ORF-II mutations diminish the ability of the virus to maintain viral loads in vivo. p30 expressed exogenously differentially modulates CREB and Tax-responsive element-mediated transcription through its interaction with CREB-binding protein/p300 and while acting as a repressor of many genes including Tax, in part by blocking tax/rex RNA nuclear export, selectively enhances key gene pathways involved in T-cell signaling/activation.\nRESULTS: Herein, we analyzed the role of p30 in cell cycle regulation. Jurkat T-cells transduced with a p30 expressing lentivirus vector accumulated in the G2-M phase of cell cycle. We then analyzed key proteins involved in G2-M checkpoint activation. p30 expression in Jurkat T-cells resulted in an increase in phosphorylation at serine 216 of nuclear cell division cycle 25C (Cdc25C), had enhanced checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) serine 345 phosphorylation, reduced expression of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), diminished phosphorylation of PLK1 at tyrosine 210 and reduced phosphorylation of Cdc25C at serine 198. Finally, primary human lymphocyte derived cell lines immortalized by a HTLV-1 proviral clone defective in p30 expression were more susceptible to camptothecin induced apoptosis. Collectively these data are consistent with a cell survival role of p30 against genotoxic insults to HTLV-1 infected lymphocytes.\nQuestion: Does human T-lymphotropic virus type-1 p30 alter cell cycle G2 regulation of T lymphocytes to enhance cell survival?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

Increasing evidence suggests that circulating progenitor cells contribute to intimal pathology, and clinical studies have demonstrated a correlation between progenitor cells and the incidence of restenosis after cardiovascular interventions. The aims of this study were to characterize the temporal response of CD34+ progenitors following vascular injury in an ovine model and to evaluate an affinity pheresis approach to attenuate this response.\nMETHODS: An ovine model underwent either operative vascular injury or a nonvascular surgery (n = 3 per group). Blood was examined perioperatively over 2 weeks by flow cytometry. Next, an affinity pheresis approach to mediate systemic depletion of CD34 progenitors was designed. Custom agarose pheresis matrix with antibody affinity toward CD34 or an isotype control was evaluated in vitro. Next, following vascular injury, sheep underwent perioperative whole blood volume pheresis toward either the progenitor cell marker CD34 (n = 3) or an isotype control (n = 4) for 14 days. Animals were monitored by physical exam as well as complete blood counts. Cells recovered by pheresis were eluted and examined by flow cytometry.\nRESULTS: Flow cytometry revealed a focal surge of circulating CD34 cells after vascular injury but not among surgical controls (P = .05). Toward the goal of an approach to attenuate the surge of CD34 progenitors, an evaluation of high-flow affinity matrix revealed efficacy in removal of progenitors from ovine blood in vitro. Next, a separate group of animals undergoing affinity pheresis after vascular injury was evaluated to mediate systemic depletion of CD34+ cells. Again, a surge of CD34+ cells was observed among isotype pheresis animals following vascular intervention but was attenuated over 20-fold by a CD34 pheresis approach (P = .029). Furthermore, an average of 77 million CD34-positive cells were eluted from the CD34 pheresis matrix.

Besides, the 5-year survival rate of ESCC remains dismal despite improvements in treatments having developed a lot. That is because the cellular basis of ESCC has not yet been fully understood. Forkhead box family membranes possess various kinds of properties as they mediate apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, autophagy, senescence and so on. Foxhead box Q1 (FOXQ1), which has a major impact on several kinds of tumor forming and metastasis, while whether it triggers ESCC remains largely obscure.\nMETHODS: To determine whether aberrant FOXQ1 expression in esophageal cancer, protein level and mRNA level of specimens of cancerous tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues were determined by western blot and real-time PCR. Then we overexpressed or knockdowned FOXQ1 in EC9706 cell; cell growth curve and colony formation were analyzed. Cell invasion ability was analyzed by migration chambers. Reporter gene assay was used to study the transcriptional regulation activity.\nRESULTS: FOXQ1 was highly expressed in esophageal cancerous tissues compared with adjacent non-cancerous tissues. FOXQ1 overexpression promotes ESCC tumor cell proliferation, whereas FOXQ1 silencing prevents ESCC tumor cell proliferation. FOXQ1 promotes ESCC metastasis via negatively modulation CDH1. CDH1 silencing could rescue the migratory ability which was blemished by FOXQ1 silencing.

Besides, increased PI3K/AKT- and ERK1/2-signalling was associated with radioresistance accompanied by loss of PTEN function through phosphorylation on S380. Blockade of pAKT increased radiation-induced cell death, and moreover, led to an upregulation of pMET in the radioresistant cell line.

The corticospinal tract (CST), for example, responds to a thoracic transection with the formation of an intraspinal detour circuit. The key step for the formation of the detour circuit is the sprouting of new CST collaterals in the cervical spinal cord that contact local interneurons. How individual collaterals are formed and refined over time is incompletely understood.\nRESULTS: We traced the hindlimb corticospinal tract at different timepoints after lesion to show that cervical collateral formation is initiated in the first 10 days. These collaterals can then persist for at least 24 weeks. Interestingly, both major and minor CST components contribute to the formation of persistent CST collaterals. We then developed an approach to label single CST collaterals based on viral gene transfer of the Cre recombinase to a small number of cortical projection neurons in Thy1-STP-YFP or Thy1-Brainbow mice. Reconstruction and analysis of single collaterals for up to 12 weeks after lesion revealed that CST remodeling evolves in 3 phases. Collateral growth is initiated in the first 10 days after lesion. Between 10 days and 3-4 weeks after lesion elongated and highly branched collaterals form in the gray matter, the complexity of which depends on the CST component they originate from.

We independently examined the relative PS-direct and affinity for phospholipids of monomeric and multimeric PS and we obtained contrasting results.\nRESULTS: Unpurified recombinant protein S (rPS) was monomeric and had PS-direct potency similar to that of both PS in plasma and multimeric affinity-purified PS, as measured in plasma assays for PS-direct and in thrombin-generation assays.

Data for the pre-operative clinical International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, post-operative pathologic FIGO stage, World Health Organization (WHO) double diameter measurement evaluation, response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST 1.1) criteria, tumor necrosis rate (TNR), and tumor regression grade (TRG) were investigated to identify correlations with outcomes related to distant metastasis and survival. The tumor invasion depth (TID) and the tumor invasion depth with cytokeratin immunostaining correction (TIDC) at the cervical internal surface were measured to assess their relations to patients' outcomes.\nRESULTS: Based on measurements taken via transvaginal ultrasound, the pre-operative clinical and post-operative pathologic FIGO staging as well as the WHO double diameter measurement evaluation and RECIST 1.1 criteria were predictive of distant metastasis and survival-related outcomes. Also, lymph node involvement was found to be an independent prognostic factor for recurrence and distant metastasis. Finally, univariate analysis showed both the TID and TIDC were highly related to distant metastasis, overall survival, and progression-free survival, irrespective of the clinical stage of carcinomas.\nQuestion: Is tumor invasion depth a useful pathologic assessment for predicting outcomes in cervical squamous cell carcinoma after neoadjuvant radiotherapy?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

MOF significantly modulated the expression of 864 genes. The majority of the affected genes are involved in chemotaxis, cell adhesion, cell infiltration or cytoskeleton organisation, suggesting lower immune cell adhesion to endothelial cells. This was corroborated by in vitro experiments showing that MOF exposure of monocytes attenuates their adhesion to TNF-α-stimulated endothelial cells.

However, the optimal strategy of DC loading has not yet been established. Our aim was to define requirements of optimal DC vaccines in terms of in vivo protection in a murine B-cell lymphoma model.\nMETHODS: We compare various loading reagents including whole parental and modified tumor cells and a single tumor-specific antigen, namely the lymphoma idiotype (Id). Bone marrow-derived DC were pulsed in vitro and used for therapy of established A20 lymphomas.\nRESULTS: We show that a vaccine with superior antitumor efficacy can be generated when DC are loaded with whole modified tumor cells which provide both (i) antigenic polyvalency and (ii) receptor-mediated antigen internalization. Uptake of cellular material was greatly enhanced when the tumor cells used for DC pulsing were engineered to express an anti-Fc receptor immunoglobulin specificity. Upon transfer of these DC, established tumor burdens were eradicated in 50% of mice. By contrast, pulsing DC with unmodified lymphoma cells or with the lymphoma Id, even when it was endowed with the anti-Fc receptor binding arm, was far less effective. A specific humoral anti-Id response could be detected, particularly following delivery of Id protein-pulsed DC, but it was not predictive of tumor protection. Instead a T-cell response was pivotal for successful tumor protection.

Experimental mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis was induced in male Wistar rats with monoclonal OX-7, anti-rat Thy-1.1 antibody with rats randomized to receive either STI 571 (50 mg/kg intraperitoneally daily) or vehicle. Animals were examined six days later.\nRESULTS: In vitro, both PDGF and FGF-2 induced a threefold increase in mesangial cell 3H-thymidine incorporation. STI 571 reduced PDGF but not FGF-2-stimulated mesangial cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, with complete abolition at 0.4 micromol/L. In animals with Thy-1.1 glomerulonephritis, PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase blockade was associated with significant reductions in mesangial cell proliferation (P < 0.001), the number of activated (alpha-smooth muscle positive) mesangial cells, and glomerular type IV collagen deposition (P < 0.001).\nQuestion: Does pDGF signal transduction inhibition ameliorate experimental mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

Anaesthetic agents are known to affect ERG, and as anaesthesia is often needed in children and uncooperative patients, knowledge about its effects is of clinical importance. Barbiturates selectively depress ERG components, and we compared thiopentone with propofol to assess if the latter preserved retinal function better.\nMETHODS: Ten pigs, average weight 17 kg (SD +/- 2 kg) were anaesthetized randomly with propofol 10 mg kg-1 or thiopentone 30 mg kg-1. Anaesthesia was maintained by 65% nitrous oxide in oxygen and continuous infusion of the induction agent, i.e. 10 mg kg-1 h-1 of propofol, or 10 mg kg-1 h-1 for the first hour, then 5 mg kg-1 h-1 of thiopentone, with doses being based on pilot studies. After an interval of one week the programme was repeated using the other agent. After 40 minutes dark-adaptation, responses to single flashes of graded intensities from a xenon flashlamp were recorded at five-minute intervals. The a- and b-wave amplitudes and implicit times (time to peak), and a-wave slopes were determined.\nRESULTS: The b-wave implicit time was significantly shorter during propofol anaesthesia than when using thiopentone. The effect was most pronounced at the lowest intensities (P < 0.01). No statistically significant differences were found in the amplitudes of the b-waves.

Its concentration in the circulation increases during fasting and decreases upon re-feeding. This has fostered the notion that the absence of food in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract stimulates the secretion of ghrelin. The purpose of the present study was to determine the concentration of ghrelin in serum and oxyntic mucosa after replacing food with intravenous (iv) infusion of nutrients for 8 days using the technique known as total parenteral nutrition (TPN) MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) were given nutrients (lipids, glucose, amino acids, minerals and vitamins) by iv infusion for 8 days during which time they were deprived of food and water; another group was deprived of food for 24-48 h (fasted controls), while fed controls had free access to food and water. Serum ghrelin, gastrin and pancreastatin concentrations were measured together with the ghrelin content of the oxyntic mucosa. Plasma insulin and glucose as well as serum lipid concentrations were also determined.\nRESULTS: Fasted rats had higher serum ghrelin than TPN rats and fed controls. The oxyntic mucosal ghrelin concentration (and content) was lower in TPN rats than in fasted rats or fed controls. The serum gastrin and pancreastatin concentrations were lower in TPN rats and fasted rats than in fed controls. The plasma insulin concentration was 87 pmol/l+/-8 (SEM) in TPN rats compared to 101+/-16 pmol/l in fed controls; it was 26+/-14 pmol/l in fasted rats. The basal plasma glucose level was 11+/-0.6 mmol/l in TPN rats and 12+/-0.8 mmol/l in fed controls; it was 7+/-0.3 mmol/l in fasted rats. In TPN rats, the serum concentrations of free fatty acids, triglycerides and cholesterol were increased by 100%, 50% and 25%, respectively, compared to fed controls.

Buffer-perfused rabbit lungs were exposed to 270 minutes of warm ischemia while anoxic ventilation and a positive intravascular pressure were maintained.\nRESULTS: On reperfusion, a massive increase of the capillary filtration coefficient and severe edema formation were noted, whereas microvascular pressures displayed only minor changes. Short-time aerosolization of subthreshold doses of either rolipram (33 microg) or PGI(2) (2.6 microg) at the beginning of ischemia did not attenuate the leakage response, whereas the co-aerosolization of both agents largely blocked any permeability increase and edema formation, independent of hemodynamic effects. The same was true when the co-aerosolization was undertaken before onset of ischemia. Similarly, the intravascular administration of rolipram and PGI(2) showed a synergistic reduction of I/R-induced vascular leak but demanded 10-fold higher doses.

Genetic factors affecting expression, turnover, and abnormal glycation of hemoglobin could also be associated with increased levels of HbA₁(c). We aimed to identify such genetic factors and investigate the extent to which they influence diabetes classification based on HbA₁(c) levels.\nMETHODS: We studied associations with HbA₁(c) in up to 46,368 nondiabetic adults of European descent from 23 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and 8 cohorts with de novo genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We combined studies using inverse-variance meta-analysis and tested mediation by glycemia using conditional analyses. We estimated the global effect of HbA₁(c) loci using a multilocus risk score, and used net reclassification to estimate genetic effects on diabetes screening.\nRESULTS: Ten loci reached genome-wide significant association with HbA(1c), including six new loci near FN3K (lead SNP/P value, rs1046896/P = 1.6 × 10⁻²⁶), HFE (rs1800562/P = 2.6 × 10⁻²⁰), TMPRSS6 (rs855791/P = 2.7 × 10⁻¹⁴), ANK1 (rs4737009/P = 6.1 × 10⁻¹²), SPTA1 (rs2779116/P = 2.8 × 10⁻⁹) and ATP11A/TUBGCP3 (rs7998202/P = 5.2 × 10⁻⁹), and four known HbA₁(c) loci: HK1 (rs16926246/P = 3.1 × 10⁻⁵⁴), MTNR1B (rs1387153/P = 4.0 × 10⁻¹¹), GCK (rs1799884/P = 1.5 × 10⁻²⁰) and G6PC2/ABCB11 (rs552976/P = 8.2 × 10⁻¹⁸).

In patients with positive test results, viral or autoimmune liver disorders were excluded by serum testing. Next, the presence of PSC was confirmed/excluded by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC).\nRESULTS: Perihepatic lymphadenopathy was detected by US in 27 of 310 (9%) patients.

XBS decreased the histological damage and up-regulation of ICAM-1 observed in lungs of mice treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In cultured human pulmonary epithelial A549 cells, XBS and its components Morus alba and Glycyrrhiza uralensis suppressed the up-regulation of IL-8 and ICAM-1 in response to LPS. Production of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-8 by LPS-treated human THP-1 monomyelocytes was also suppressed by XBS. A549 cells expressed ICAM-1 in response to medium from LPS-treated THP-1 cells; expression was decreased by XBS. The adhesion of THP-1 cells to LPS-treated A549 cells were inhibited in the presence of XBS. Activation of NF-kappaB by LPS in A549 cells was suppressed by XBS, Morus alba, and Glycyrrhiza uralensis through inhibition of IkappaB phosphorylation; the concentrations at which suppression occurred were identical to those at which production of inflammatory cytokines and up-regulation of ICAM-1 were inhibited.\nQuestion: Does xia-bai-san inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced activation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and nuclear factor-kappa B in human lung cells?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

SWI/SNF complexes are recruited to chromatin through multiple mechanisms, including specific DNA-binding factors (for example, heat shock transcription factor 4 (Hsf4) and paired box gene 6 (Pax6)), chromatin structural proteins (for example, high-mobility group A1 (HMGA1)) and/or acetylated core histones. Previous studies have shown that a single amino acid substitution (K798R) in the Brg1 ATPase domain acts via a dominant-negative (dn) mechanism. Genetic studies have demonstrated that Brg1 is an essential gene for early (that is, prior implantation) mouse embryonic development. Brg1 also controls neural stem cell maintenance, terminal differentiation of multiple cell lineages and organs including the T-cells, glial cells and limbs.\nRESULTS: To examine the roles of Brg1 in mouse lens development, a dnBrg1 transgenic construct was expressed using the lens-specific αA-crystallin promoter in postmitotic lens fiber cells. Morphological studies revealed abnormal lens fiber cell differentiation in transgenic lenses resulting in cataract. Electron microscopic studies showed abnormal lens suture formation and incomplete karyolysis (that is, denucleation) of lens fiber cells. To identify genes regulated by Brg1, RNA expression profiling was performed in embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) wild-type and dnBrg1 transgenic lenses. In addition, comparisons between differentially expressed genes in dnBrg1 transgenic, Pax6 heterozygous and Hsf4 homozygous lenses identified multiple genes coregulated by Brg1, Hsf4 and Pax6. DNase IIβ, a key enzyme required for lens fiber cell denucleation, was found to be downregulated in each of the Pax6, Brg1 and Hsf4 model systems. Lens-specific deletion of Brg1 using conditional gene targeting demonstrated that Brg1 was required for lens fiber cell differentiation, for expression of DNase IIβ, for lens fiber cell denucleation and indirectly for retinal development.\nQuestion: Is chromatin remodeling enzyme Brg1 required for mouse lens fiber cell terminal differentiation and its denucleation?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

The major peach allergen was purified by HPLC with a cation-exchange column followed by gel filtration chromatography. Its IgE-binding capacity and its homology with the protein of the crude extract were demonstrated by immunoblotting inhibition techniques. To better characterize this allergen, periodic acid-Schiff stain and isoelectrofocusing were used. The amino acid sequencing was done with a gas-phase sequencer.\nRESULTS: SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting of the 15 patients allergic to peach, 8 without and 7 with birch pollinosis, showed that they all recognized a protein with a molecular weight of 9 kd. This was the only allergen recognized by patients not sensitized to pollen, whereas the birch pollen-sensitive patients had IgE binding to other allergenic proteins at higher molecular weights. The purified 9-kd protein retained its IgE-binding capacity, was negative to periodic acid-Schiff stain, and had an isoelectric point value of greater than 9.

Serum was assayed for levels of total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglycerides (TG). LDL was calculated by subtraction of TG/5 and HDL from TC. Data were examined using Fisher's exact, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox regression analyses.\nRESULTS: One hundred thirty-two patients were studied. Twenty-six percent of patients had elevated LDL; 18% had elevated TC; 32% had elevated TG; and 48% had elevated HDL. No univariate associations were identified between elevated TC, HDL, TG, LDL and age, stage IV disease, high grade, or optimal cytoreduction. Median progression-free survival for patients with normal LDL levels was 27 months, compared to 12 months for patients with elevated LDL (p=0.0004). Overall disease-specific survival was longer for patients with normal LDL levels (59 months) compared to those with elevated LDL (51 months, p=0.04).

In addition, a nonsurgical method for long-term myocardial adrenergic denervation is desirable but has not been accomplished or described with respect to catecholamine supersensitivity.\nRESULTS: We have accomplished chronic myocardial adrenergic denervation by using 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Sixteen weeks after 6-OHDA administration to newborn pigs, we found substantial myocardial adrenergic denervation associated with beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) downregulation. Despite decreased beta AR number, the dose of isoproterenol yielding 50% maximal heart rate change (ED50) was decreased, and heart rates during exercise showed increased responsiveness despite decreased circulating catecholamines. Thus, stimulation of fewer receptors yielded an increased response, implying improved signal transduction efficiency. Competitive binding studies with isoproterenol showed an increased proportion of beta AR with high-affinity binding in myocardial membranes from 6-OHDA pigs, suggesting that interaction between beta AR and cardiac G, may contribute to improved signal transduction efficiency. However, measures of adenylyl cyclase activity indicated marked reduction in beta AR-dependent and G2-dependent cAMP production in myocardial membranes from denervated animals despite a normal amount of cardiac Gs and decreased Gi.\nQuestion: Does myocardial adrenergic denervation supersensitivity depend on a postreceptor mechanism not linked with increased cAMP production?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

The antiangiogenic activity of TSP-1, as defined by cornea pocket assays, was previously mapped to the amino-terminal portion of the protein within the procollagen region and the type 1 repeats.\nRESULTS: We evaluated the specificity and efficacy of different regions of TSP-1 using recombinant fragments of the protein on chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) angiogenesis and endothelial cell proliferation assays. In both assays, fragments containing the second and third type 1 repeats but not the procollagen region inhibited angiogenesis and endothelial cell proliferation. To further define the sequences responsible for the angiostatic effect of TSP-1, we used synthetic peptides. The CAM assay defined 2 sequences that independently suppressed angiogenesis. The amino-terminal end of the type 1 repeats showed higher potency for inhibiting angiogenesis driven by basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), whereas the second region equally blocked angiogenesis driven by either FGF-2 or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Modifications of the active peptides revealed the specific amino acids required for the inhibitory response. One sequence included the conserved tryptophan residues in the amino-terminal end of the second and third type 1 repeats, and the other involved the amino acids that follow the CSVTCG sequence in the carboxy-terminus of these repeats. Both inhibition in the CAM assay and inhibition of breast tumor xenograft growth in nude mice were independent of the TGF-beta-activating sequence located in the second type 1 repeat.\nQuestion: Is inhibition of angiogenesis by thrombospondin-1 mediated by 2 independent regions within the type 1 repeats?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

However, the mechanism through which early life stress contributes to disease development remains unclear. Previous studies have reported an association between early life stress and altered methylation of the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4), a key candidate gene for several psychiatric disorders. These differences in methylation are influenced by sex and genetic variation in the SLC6A4-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR). Furthermore, one study indicated that stress during pregnancy may induce methylation changes in SLC6A4 in the newborn. The present study is the first to investigate whether early life stress during pregnancy impacts on SLC6A4 methylation in newborns, taking into account the influence of genetic variation and sex.\nMETHODS: Cord blood was obtained from newborns with high (n = 45) or low (n = 45) early life stress, defined as maternal stress during pregnancy. The effect on methylation of early life stress, 5-HTTLPR genotype, and sex was assessed at four cytosin-phosphate-guanine dinucleotide (CpG) sites in the promoter associated CpG island north shore (CpG 1 to 4). The epigenetic analyses focused on these CpG sites, since research has shown that CpG island shore methylation has functional consequences.\nRESULTS: Significant sex-specific methylation was observed, with females displaying higher methylation levels than males (p < 0.001).

We evaluated the potential value of contrast-enhanced imaging and tissue harmonic imaging over standard fundamental imaging for endocardial border detection (EBD) in these patients.\nRESULTS: Fifty patients underwent standard transthoracic 2D echocardiography and were imaged in fundamental and tissue harmonic modes and subsequently with intravenous contrast (Optison). Two echocardiographers reviewed all studies for ease of visualization of endocardial border segments and scoring of wall motion. EBD for each wall segment was graded from 1 to 4 (1 = excellent EBD). Wall motion was scored by a standard 16-segment model and 1 to 5 scale. Studies were categorized as nondiagnostic if 4 of 6 segments in the apical 4-chamber view were either poorly seen or not seen (EBD score 3 or 4). Quantification of ejection fraction was independently performed offline. Visualization of 68% of all segments improved with contrast echocardiography versus 17% improvement with tissue harmonics compared with fundamental mode. Significant improvement (poor/not seen to good/excellent) occurred in 60% of segments with contrast echocardiography versus 18% with tissue harmonics. A total of 850 segments were deemed poor/not seen, 78% of which improved to good/excellent with contrast echocardiography versus 23% with tissue harmonics. Interobserver agreement on EBD was 64% to 70%. Conversion of nondiagnostic to diagnostic studies occurred in 85% of patients with contrast echocardiography versus 15% of patients with tissue harmonics. Scoring of wall motion with fundamental mode, tissue harmonics, and contrast echocardiography was possible in 61%, 74%, and 95% of individual segments, respectively (P <.001). Wall motion scoring was altered in 17% of segments with contrast echocardiography and in 8% with tissue harmonics. Interobserver agreement on wall motion scoring was 84% to 88%.

Data were collected all on adult burn patients who experienced in-hospital CA and CPR either in the BICU or associated burn operating room. Patients undergoing CPR elsewhere in our burn unit were excluded because we could not validate the time of CA since they are not routinely monitored with real-time rhythm strips. The study population included civilian burn patients from the local catchment area and burn casualties from the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, but patients with do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders were excluded.\nRESULTS: We found 57 burn patients who had in-hospital CA and CPR yielding an incidence of one or more in-hospital CA of 34 per 1000 admissions (0.34%). Fourteen of these patients (25%) survived to discharge while 43 (75%) died. The most common initial cardiac rhythm was pulseless electrical activity (50.9%).

All patients treated with renal artery stenting by the Interventional Radiology or Endovascular Services were included. Descriptive and inferential analyses were performed.\nRESULTS: Forty patients with renal artery stenosis were evaluated for renal artery stenting, of these 22 were followed up with medical management. Twenty-six renal artery stents were placed in 18 patients (mean age, 70 +/- 8 years), of whom 76% were treated for multidrug resistant hypertension, and 24% were treated for renal salvage. Mean follow-up was 15 months. Patients experienced a significant reduction in hypertension and in the number of antihypertensive agents, but this significance deteriorated at 6 months, when their blood pressure and number of medications returned to preprocedural values. Compared with a cohort that was followed up with medical management, the rate of renal function decline improved from -0.08 mg/dL per month to 0.00 mg/dL per month (P < .05) after intervention.

First, thrombi were classified as fresh, lytic or organized. Second, percentages of red blood cells (RBCs), platelets and fibrin and number of red, white (respectively RBCs or platelets outnumbering other components with ≥ 15%) or mixed thrombi were compared between large artery atherosclerosis (LAA), cardioembolism, dissection and unknown subtype.

The stroke cause was LAA in eight (36%), cardioembolism in six (27%), dissection in three (14%), and unknown in five (23%) patients. LAA thrombi showed the highest percentage RBCs (median 50 (range 35-90)), followed by dissection (35 (20-40), p = 0.05), cardioembolism (35 (5-45), p = 0.013) and unknown subtype (25 (2-40), p = 0.006). No differences in platelets (p = 0.16) and fibrin (p = 0.52) between subtypes were found.

Thermal hyperalgesia was monitored using an infrared thermal probe. C-fiber size, number, frequencies of denervated Schwann cells, regenerating C-fibers, type 2 axon/Schwann cell relationship and collagen pockets in the sural nerve were examined morphometrically. Neurotrophic receptor expression was examined by Western blotting. Neurotrophins and neuropeptides were examined by ELISA.\nRESULTS: Type 1 rats showed increased thermal hyperalgesia followed by a decrease. Hyperalgesia in type 2 rats showed a slower progression. These findings were associated with a 50% (p < 0.001) loss of C-fibers, increased frequencies of denervated Schwann cells (p < 0.001), regenerating fibers (p < 0.001), collagen pockets (p < 0.001) and type 2 axon/Schwann cell relationship (p < 0.001) in type 1, but not in type 2 rats.

Its activity is modulated by cellular oxidants. Hepatitis C core protein and ethanol exposure both cause enhanced oxidant generation. The aim was to investigate whether core protein, by its ability to generate oxidants, alters proteasome activity and whether these alterations are further affected by ethanol exposure.\nMETHODS: These interactions were examined in Huh-7 cell lines that expressed inducible HCV core protein and/or constitutive cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) and as purified components in a cell-free system. Chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity was measured fluorometrically.\nRESULTS: Proteasome activity in core-positive 191-20 cells was 20% higher than that in core-negative cells and was enhanced 3-fold in CYP2E1-expressing L14 cells. Exposure of core-positive cells to glutathione ethyl ester, catalase, or the CYP2E1 inhibitor diallyl sulfide partially reversed the elevation of proteasome activity in core-positive cells, whereas ethanol exposure suppressed proteasome activity. The results indicate that proteasome activity was up-regulated by low levels of core-induced oxidative stress but down-regulated by high levels of ethanol-elicited stress. These findings were partially mimicked in a cell-free system. Addition of core protein enhanced the peptidase activity of purified 20S proteasome containing the proteasome activator PA28 and was further potentiated by addition of liver mitochondrial and/or microsome fractions.

Axillary meristem activity, and hence shoot branching, is regulated by a network of interacting hormonal signals that move through the plant. Among these, auxin, moving down the plant in the main stem, indirectly inhibits axillary bud outgrowth, and an as yet undefined hormone, the synthesis of which in Arabidopsis requires MAX1, MAX3, and MAX4, moves up the plant and also inhibits shoot branching. Since the axillary buds of max4 mutants are resistant to the inhibitory effects of apically supplied auxin, auxin and the MAX-dependent hormone must interact to inhibit branching.\nRESULTS: Here we show that the resistance of max mutant buds to apically supplied auxin is largely independent of the known, AXR1-mediated, auxin signal transduction pathway. Instead, it is caused by increased capacity for auxin transport in max primary stems, which show increased expression of PIN auxin efflux facilitators. The max phenotype is dependent on PIN1 activity, but it is independent of flavonoids, which are known regulators of PIN-dependent auxin transport.\nQuestion: Does the Arabidopsis MAX pathway control shoot branching by regulating auxin transport?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

Plants encode a unique class of sRNAs, called trans-acting small interfering RNAs (tasiRNAs), which post-transcriptionally regulate protein-coding transcripts, as do microRNAs (miRNAs), and both sRNA classes control development through their targets. TasiRNA biogenesis requires multiple components of the siRNA pathway and also miRNAs. But while 21mer siRNAs originating from transgenes can mediate silencing across several cell layers, miRNA action seems spatially restricted to the producing or closely surrounding cells.\nRESULTS: We have previously described the isolation of a genetrap reporter line for TAS3a, the major locus producing AUXIN RESPONS FACTOR (ARF)-regulating tasiRNAs in the Arabidopsis shoot. Its activity is limited to the adaxial (upper) side of leaf primordia, thus spatially isolated from ARF-activities, which are located in the abaxial (lower) side.

Surgery is the primary curative modality but is achieved only when the diagnosis is timely so there is a high rate of persistent and recurrent disease indicated by a rise in the serum calcitonin levels. Successful management of recurrent disease requires accurate localisation with cross sectional and functional imaging. The introduction of gallium-68-Dotatate ((68)Ga-Dotatate) peptides positron emission tomography/computerized tomography (PET/CT) has significantly improved the detection of NET and has been reported as a valuable adjunct in MTC localisation. We retrospectively reviewed our cases of MTC to correlate the detectability of (68)Ga-Dotatate in relation to calcitonin levels and assess suitability of inoperable patients for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT).\nMETHODS: Seven patients (age range 31-66 years, M:F 3:4) with raised calcitonin (mean=7,143pg/mL) were referred for (68)Ga-Dotatate PET/CT scan for localisation of persisting recurrent MTC. Six patients were known to have MTC treated with thyroidectomy and one patient was presenting for the first time. All patients had multiple imaging including ultrasound (US), CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) PET/CT and iodine-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine ((123)I-MIBG). Positive findings were defined as areas of increased uptake other than the organs of normal distribution and were correlated with results of biopsies, other imaging, long term monitoring of calcitonin and clinical follow up.\nRESULTS: In 6/7 patients with very high serum calcitonin (range= 672-37,180, mean=8,320pg/mL) (68)Ga-Dotatate PET/CT confirmed the presence of active disease seen on other modalities or detected hitherto unsuspected lesions. In at least 3 cases, (68)Ga-Dotatate PET/CT showed many more lesions compared to other imaging combined.

The association between Glasgow Coma Scale score, age, gender, treatment, temperature, time after injury, and CSF antioxidant reserve, glutathione, protein-thiol, F2-isoprostane levels were assessed by bivariate and multiple regression models. Demographic and clinical characteristics were similar between the two treatment groups. Mechanism of injury included both accidental injury and nonaccidental injury.

Till now, accumulating evidence has proposed the pivotal role of toll-like receptors (TLRs) in renal inflammation in diabetic patients. In this setting, the current study aimed to investigate the effects and underlying mechanism of PF on high glucose-induced activation of toll like-receptor 2 (TLR2) signaling in macrophages.\nMETHODS: Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were isolated from male Tlr2\nRESULTS: PF suppressed HG-induced production of TLR2, activation of downstream signaling and synthesis of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). PF could further inhibit MyD88-dependent pathway in HG-induced models in which TLR2 was knocked out. Moreover, deletion of TLR2 inhibited the HG-induced activation of MyD88-dependent pathway, but not TIR domain containing adapter inducing interferon-β (Trif) signal pathway in BMDMs. As HG stimulation polarizes macrophages into M1 phenotype, treatment of PF or knockout of TLR2 significantly reduces M1 markers on the membrane of macrophages.

Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess independent relationships with primary outcome variables.\nRESULTS: Responses from 1161 HIV-negative and untested men were analysed. Prior use of antiretroviral drugs as PrEP was rare (n=6). Just over a quarter of the sample (n=327; 28.2%) was classified as willing to use PrEP.

However the correlation between telomerase activity and hTERT mRNA expression has not been previously examined in human breast cancer. The present study aims to quantitatively measure the expression of hTERT mRNA and telomerase activity in human breast cancer and examine the relationship between these parameters. Furthermore the associations with other parameters including estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) status, DNA ploidy, and S-phase fraction (SPF) are also examined.\nMETHODS: RNA was extracted from 18 breast carcinomas and hTERT mRNA expressions were estimated by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) and Taqman methodology. These tumours had already been analysed for ER and PgR status using ligand-binding assays and had had their DNA ploidy and S-phase fractions measured by flow cytometry. Telomerase activity had already been determined by using a modified telomeric repeat and amplification protocol (TRAP) assay.\nRESULTS: The expression of hTERT mRNA in the breast tumours ranged between 1.3 and 2.7 x 10(7) copy numbers per micro g of cellular RNA (the median value was 2.7x10(5) and the mean was 3.1 x 10(6)). Telomerase activity was between 0 and 246 units of Total Protein Generated (TPG), where one unit of TPG was equal to 600 molecules, of telomerase substrate primers extended by at least three telomeric repeats. The median level of TPG was 60 units and the mean level was 81 units). Telomerase activity was found to significantly correlate with hTERT expression (r(s)=0.51112, P=0.0302).

Although the gamma contamination of the neutron beam cannot be completely eliminated, it was designed to be as low as possible and remain below a threshold already established for bystander effects. Microdosimetric methods using a tissue-equivalent proportional counter have been used to measure the neutron and gamma doses for the cell irradiation. Previous data for a cell line exposed in vitro suggested that neutrons did not produce bystander effects at doses below 300 mGy. The current experiments sought to confirm this using a live whole organism (zebrafish) where tissue samples harvested 2 h after exposure were examined for direct evidence of apoptosis and tested for secretion of bystander factors using an established bioassay. Fish were either exposed directly to the beam or were allowed to swim with or in water previously occupied by irradiated fish.\nRESULTS: Using the zebrafish model it was found that there was significant direct cell death seen both by apoptosis scores and clonogenic assay when the neutron dose was approximately 100 mGy. An equivalent dose of gamma rays produced a more toxic effect.

However, it is unknown whether this benefit of beta-blockers is dependent on heart rate control. The aim of this study was to assess whether rate control affects survival in patients receiving metoprolol with severe TBI. Our hypothesis was that improved survival from beta-blockade would be associated with a reduction in heart rate.\nMETHODS: We performed a 7-y retrospective analysis of all blunt TBI patients at a level-1 trauma center. Patients aged >16 y with head abbreviated injury scale 4 or 5, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) from the operating room or emergency room (ER), were included. Patients were stratified into two groups: metoprolol and no beta-blockers. Using propensity score matching, we matched the patients in two groups in a 1:1 ratio controlling for age, gender, race, admission vital signs, Glasgow coma scale, injury severity score, mean heart rate monitored during ICU admission, and standard deviation of heart rate during the ICU admission. Our primary outcome measure was mortality.\nRESULTS: A total of 914 patients met our inclusion criteria, of whom 189 received beta-blockers. A propensity-matched cohort of 356 patients (178: metoprolol and 178: no beta-blockers) was created. Patients receiving metoprolol had higher survival than those patients who did not receive beta-blockers (78% versus 68%; P = 0.04); however, there was no difference in the mean heart rate (89.9 ± 13.9 versus 89.9 ± 15; P = 0.99).

Rat alveolar and peritoneal macrophages were each probed for the expression of PKC isoforms alpha, beta1, beta2, gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta, and theta by immunoblot. PKC isoforms alpha, beta1, beta2, and zeta were detected in both populations; however, isoforms epsilon, gamma, and eta were found in alveolar macrophages only.

Bile, despite containing high concentrations of bile salts, normally is not toxic to biliary or intestinal epithelia. We hypothesize that lecithin in bile may protect cell membranes from disruption by bile salts.\nMETHODS: We studied the interactions of taurine conjugates of ursodeoxycholate (TUDCA), cholate (TCA), chenodeoxycholate (TCDCA), and deoxycholate (TDCA) with erythrocyte plasma membranes with or without large unilamellar egg lecithin vesicles for various times at 23 degreesC.

The concentration of bile salt monomers and simple micelles in the intermixed micellar aqueous phase (IMMC) was determined by centrifugal ultrafiltration.\nRESULTS: The degree of hemolysis depended on the hydrophobicity of the bile salts and was progressive over time. Addition of lecithin reduced the hemolytic effects of 20 mM TCA or 2 mM TDCA in a concentration-dependent manner at both 30 min and 4 h.

However, the in vivo role of Trx2 in angiogenesis has not been defined. Here we used EC-specific transgenesis of Trx2 (Trx2-TG) in mice to determine the in vivo function of Trx2 in arteriogenesis and angiogenesis.\nRESULTS: In a femoral artery ligation model, Trx2-TG mice had enhanced capacity in limb perfusion recovery and ischemic reserve capacity compared to the nontransgenic littermates. Ischemia-initiated arteriogenesis in the upper limb was augmented in Trx2-TG mice. Trx2-TG mice also showed significantly enhanced capillary formation and maturation in the lower limb. In nontransgenic limb, ischemia specifically induced a downregulation of Trx2 protein, leading to increased oxidative stress, ASK1 activation, and EC apoptosis. In contrast, Trx2-TG maintained a constitutive level of Trx2, reducing the ischemia-induced deleterious responses. We then defined the mechanism by which Trx2 increases angiogenesis using ECs isolated from Trx2-TG mice. Trx2-TG ECs showed increased NO and NO-dependent migration. In addition, these cells were more resistant to oxidative stress-induced activation of ASK1 signaling and apoptosis. Moreover, Trx2-augmented EC survival is NO-independent. To define the relative contributions of Trx2-increased NO and Trx2-reduced ASK1 apoptotic activity to angiogenesis in vivo, we examined Trx2 effects on ischemia-induced angiogenesis in eNOS-deficient mice. The eNOS deletion caused severe impairment in the functional flow recovery in response to ischemia. Trx2 expression in eNOS-KO mice still dramatically inhibited ischemia-induced ASK1 and EC apoptosis, leading to an enhanced functional flow recovery.\nQuestion: Does endothelial-specific expression of mitochondrial thioredoxin promote ischemia-mediated arteriogenesis and angiogenesis?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

This raises the question whether the salivary pellet, which is used for diagnostic purposes, also has a pro-inflammatory capacity and, if yes, what the underlying mechanisms at the molecular level are.\nMETHODS: We examined the ability of extensively washed salivary pellets to provoke the expression of chemokines in gingival fibroblasts by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunoassays. Protein composition was determined with proteomic analysis. Endotoxins were analyzed by a Limulus assay and removed by affinity chromatography. The inhibitors TAK-242 and BAY11-7082 were used to determine the involvement of the TLR4 and NF-kB signaling, respectively. Western blot was performed to detect phosphorylated p65.\nRESULTS: The experiments show that salivary pellets and the corresponding washing solution contain pro-inflammatory activity without impairing cell viability. Proteomic analysis revealed proteins with a binding capacity for lipopolysaccharides, and the Limulus assay indicated the presence of endotoxin in the salivary pellets. Blocking TLR4 with TAK-242 and depletion of endotoxins both lowered the capacity of salivary pellets to increase chemokine expression and phosphorylation of p65.

Members of this subfamily function as early-response genes regulating key cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Although NOR1 has previously been demonstrated to be required for smooth muscle cell proliferation in vitro, the role of this nuclear receptor for the proliferative response underlying neointima formation and target genes trans-activated by NOR1 remain to be defined.\nRESULTS: Using a model of guidewire-induced arterial injury, we demonstrate decreased neointima formation in NOR1(-/-) mice compared with wild-type mice. In vitro, NOR1-deficient smooth muscle cells exhibit decreased proliferation as a result of a G(1)-->S phase arrest of the cell cycle and increased apoptosis in response to serum deprivation. NOR1 deficiency alters phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein by preventing mitogen-induced cyclin D1 and D2 expression. Conversely, overexpression of NOR1 induces cyclin D1 expression and the transcriptional activity of the cyclin D1 promoter in transient reporter assays. Gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays identified a putative response element for NR4A receptors in the cyclin D1 promoter, to which NOR1 is recruited in response to mitogenic stimulation. Finally, we provide evidence that these observations are applicable in vivo by demonstrating decreased cyclin D1 expression during neointima formation in NOR1-deficient mice.\nQuestion: Does deficiency of the NR4A neuron-derived orphan receptor-1 attenuate neointima formation after vascular injury?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

In this study, we evaluated tissue samples from untreated patients to determine the relation between MYC amplification and clinical and pathological factors, including survival.\nMETHODS: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples were obtained from 77 patients with SCLC who underwent a diagnostic biopsy for SCLC. The samples were analyzed by CISH using a MYC probe (ZytoDot(®) CISH probe). The relationship between cytogenetic analysis, pathologic characteristics and survival time was evaluated using the Chi-square test, Fisher's test and Mann-Whitney method. A regression model was constructed to exclude any confounding factors.\nRESULTS: Of 77 samples, 64.9 % were from bronchi biopsy and the remainder was from the mediastinal, cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes.

To elucidate genetic polymorphisms associated with a susceptibility to radiation-induced dermatitis, a large-scale single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis using DNA samples from 156 patients with breast cancer was conducted.\nMETHODS: Patients were selected from more than 3,000 female patients with early breast cancer who received radiotherapy after undergoing breast-conserving surgery. The dermatitis group was defined as patients who developed dermatitis at a National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria grade of > or =2. For the SNP analysis, DNA samples from each patient were subjected to the genotyping of 3,144 SNPs covering 494 genes.\nRESULTS: SNPs that mapped to two genes, ABCA1 and IL12RB2, were associated with radiation-induced dermatitis. In the ABCA1 gene, one of these SNPs was a nonsynonymous coding SNP causing R219K (P = 0.0065). As for the IL12RB2 gene, the strongest association was observed at SNP-K (rs3790568; P = 0.0013).

To this purpose, CTNNB1 mutation spectrum was analyzed in 220 HCAs, 373 HCCs, and 17 borderline HCA/HCC lesions. ß-catenin activation level was assessed in tumors by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry (IHC), in cellulo by TOP-Flash assay. Overall, ß-catenin activity was higher in malignant mutated tumors, compared to adenomas, and this was related to a different spectrum of CTNNB1 mutations in HCCs and HCAs. In benign tumors, we defined three levels of ß-catenin activation related to specific mutations: (1) S45, K335, and N387 mutations led to weak activation; (2) T41 mutations were related to moderate activity; and (3) highly active mutations included exon 3 deletions and amino acid substitutions within the ß-TRCP binding site (D32-S37). Accordingly, in vitro, K335I and N387K mutants showed a lower activity than S33C. Tumors with highly active mutations demonstrated strong/homogeneous glutamine synthase (GS) staining and were associated with malignancy. In contrast, weak mutants demonstrated heterogeneous pattern of GS staining and were more frequent in HCAs except for the S45 mutants identified similarly in 20% of mutated HCAs and HCCs; however, in most of the HCCs, the weak S45 mutant alleles were duplicated, resulting in a final high ß-catenin activity.\nQuestion: Does genotype-phenotype correlation of CTNNB1 mutations reveal different ß-catenin activity associated with liver tumor progression?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

We assessed whether adding simvastatin to standard therapy could reduce rebleeding and death after variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis.\nMETHODS: We performed a multicenter, double-blind, parallel trial of 158 patients with cirrhosis receiving standard prophylaxis to prevent rebleeding (a β-blocker and band ligation) in Spain from October 2010 through October 2013. Within 10 days of bleeding, subjects were randomly assigned, but stratified by Child-Pugh class of A or B vs C, to groups given simvastatin (20 mg/d the first 15 days, 40 mg/d thereafter; n = 69) or placebo (n = 78). Patients were followed for as long as 24 months. The primary end point was a composite of rebleeding and death, and main secondary end points were the individual components of the composite (death and rebleeding).\nRESULTS: The primary end point was met by 30 of 78 patients in the placebo group and 22 of 69 in the simvastatin group (P = .423). Seventeen patients in the placebo group died (22%) vs 6 patients in the simvastatin group (9%) (hazard ratio for adding simvastatin to therapy = 0.39; 95% confidence interval: 0.15-0.99; P = .030). Simvastatin did not increase survival of patients with Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis. Rebleeding occurred in 28% of patients in the placebo group and 25% in the simvastatin group (P = .583). Serious adverse events occurred in 53% of patients in the placebo group and 49% in the simvastatin group (P = .752); the percentages of serious adverse events related to therapy were 11% in the placebo group vs 8% in the in the simvastatin group (P = .599).

Repair of more technically challenging hernias, such as patients previously receiving prostatectomy, has been less studied and may not have these advantages. We aimed to compare safety, feasibility, and clinical outcomes for repairs in patients who previously underwent prostatectomy to control subjects.\nMETHODS: We undertook a case-control study using a prospectively collected database. From 2004, all patients were routinely offered totally extraperitoneal laparoscopic repair. All patients who had a history of previous prostatectomy were identified and compared to a matched control group. Both operative and follow-up data were analyzed.\nRESULTS: Of 987 patients undergoing surgery during this time period, 52 prostatectomy patients were identified (44% open, 44% robotic, 3% laparoscopic) and matched to 102 control subjects. Accounting for bilateral repairs, 203 hernia repairs had been performed. Patients were well matched for age and American Society of Anesthesiologists score. Operative time was longer for prostatectomy patients (mean, 70 vs. 52 min, p < 0.0001); however, this reduced over time when comparing the first and second half prostatectomy patients (77 vs. 63 min, p = 0.144). Overall, there were no intraoperative or major postoperative complications and only one conversion (prostatectomy group). No significant differences were found for rates of minor postoperative complications, length of stay, or recurrence (n = 1, control group).

This reflected the decline in thymic export as shown by recent thymic emigrant (RTE) enumeration. Orchidectomy increased the count of both of the major T-splenocyte subsets in young rats, and they (differently from controls) remained stable with aging. The CD4+:CD8+ T-splenocyte ratio in ORX rats shifted towards CD4+ cells compared to age-matched controls. Although in the major T-cell subsets in the blood and spleen from aged ORX rats the numbers of RTEs were comparable to the corresponding values in age-matched controls, the numbers of mature naïve and memory/activated cells substantially differed. Compared with age-matched controls, in aged ORX rats the numbers of CD4+ mature naïve PBLs and splenocytes were reduced, whereas those of CD4+ memory/activated cells (predictive of early mortality) were increased. Additionally, in spleens from aged ORX rats, despite unaltered thymic export, CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ and natural killer T cell counts were greater than in age-matched controls.\nQuestion: Do androgens contribute to age-associated changes in peripheral T-cell homeostasis acting in a thymus-independent way?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

When spacers are expressed, they direct CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins to silence complementary invading DNA. In order to characterize the invaders of human microbiomes, we use spacers from CRISPR arrays that we had previously assembled from shotgun metagenomic datasets, and identify contigs that contain these spacers' targets.\nRESULTS: We discover 95,000 contigs that are putative invasive mobile genetic elements, some targeted by hundreds of CRISPR spacers. We find that oral sites in healthy human populations have a much greater variety of mobile genetic elements than stool samples. Mobile genetic elements carry genes encoding diverse functions: only 7% of the mobile genetic elements are similar to known phages or plasmids, although a much greater proportion contain phage- or plasmid-related genes. A small number of contigs share similarity with known integrative and conjugative elements, providing the first examples of CRISPR defenses against this class of element. We provide detailed analyses of a few large mobile genetic elements of various types, and a relative abundance analysis of mobile genetic elements and putative hosts, exploring the dynamic activities of mobile genetic elements in human microbiomes. A joint analysis of mobile genetic elements and CRISPRs shows that protospacer-adjacent motifs drive their interaction network; however, some CRISPR-Cas systems target mobile genetic elements lacking motifs.\nQuestion: Do cRISPR-Cas systems target a diverse collection of invasive mobile genetic elements in human microbiomes?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

Following the immobilization, CPSso acquired distinctly higher long-term stability at room temperature compared to the free native enzyme, which, in contrast, underwent extensive inactivation after 72 h incubation, thus suggesting a potential utilization of this enzyme under low energy consumption. Moreover, CPSso conjugation also resulted in a significantly higher stability in organic solvents at 40°C, which made it possible to synthesize N-blocked amino acids in remarkably higher yields compared to those of free enzyme.\nQuestion: Does immobilization of carboxypeptidase from Sulfolobus solfataricus on magnetic nanoparticles improve enzyme stability and functionality in organic media?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is and important inflammatory cytokine with diverse effects including the ability to increase vascular endothelial cell permeability and to alter the structure of the endothelial cell glycocalyx. We have previously shown that arteriolar sensitivity to vasoactive materials is influenced by a barrier property of the arteriolar endothelium, and here we test the hypothesis that TNF-alpha might increase intimal permeability and thereby increase the access of circulating arginine-vasopressin (AVP) to vascular smooth muscle. Our objective in the current work was to show that TNF-alpha-mediated modulation of intimal cell permeability may produce both quantitative and qualitative alterations in vascular reactivity to arginine-vasopressin.\nMETHODS: Hamster cheek pouch arterioles (approximately 65 microm, i.d.) were double-cannulated and perfused. [Arg8]-vasopressin was applied selectively to either the luminal or the adventitial surface of isolated cannulated arterioles. The reactivity of the arterioles to vasopressin was determined in the presence and absence of TNF-alpha (0.625 microg/mL; 1 hour).\nRESULTS: Adventially applied AVP induced a concentration-dependent vasoconstriction with a threshold of approximately 1 pM, and a maximal constriction at 10 nM. In contrast, luminally applied AVP induced a biphasic response, showing a modest vasodilation in the range of 1 to 100 pM, and constrictions at doses higher than 1 nM. Maximal constrictions were not obtained with luminal doses of AVP as high as 1 microM; (i.e., at doses 100-fold higher than those that produced maximal responses with adventitial application). Dilations induced by luminal application of AVP were significantly attenuated by 10 microM Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), but were not altered by 10 microM indomethacin. After treatment with TNF-alpha, the concentration-response curve for luminally applied AVP showed a more pronounced constriction and the dilator component of the agonist was eliminated. There was no change in the reactivity to adventitially applied AVP or to adventitial applications of acetylcholine. Nonspecific increases in endothelial cell permeability induced by 3-[(3-chloroamino-dopropyl)-dimethylamino]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) also eliminated the potency differences between luminal and adventitial drug application. Following TNF-alpha treatment and loss of the dilator component of the response to AVP, L-NAME was still capable of reducing the arteriolar sensitivity to ACh, thus showing that the endothelial cell machinery for NO production was intact following TNF-alpha treatment.\nQuestion: Does tNF-alpha modulate arteriolar reactivity secondary to a change in intimal permeability?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

One approach to scaffolding a tissue-engineered heart valve is through the 'decellularization' of xenogeneic tissues. Concerns regarding the completeness of antigen removal associated with current detergent-based decellularization treatments have been raised. The study aim was to evaluate antigen removal from candidate xenogeneic bioscaffolds using a novel tissue-gel electrophoresis (TGE) method.\nMETHODS: Porcine aortic valve (PAV) conduit and bovine pericardium (BP) were treated sequentially with hypotonic lysis, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and TGE. The completeness of antigen removal was evaluated by immunoblot analysis of extractable soluble proteins using rabbit anti-PAV or anti-BP serum. Tissues were also evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin histology.\nRESULTS: TGE enhanced antigen removal from both the PAV and BP. The effects of TGE were shown to depend on the SDS concentration and voltage (60 versus 120 V), but to be independent of time after 4 h. The effects of TGE were detectable both before and after 96 h aqueous washout.

Activation of Pyk2 was Src-dependent, but did not require phospholipase Cγ2 activity. Platelets from Pyk2 knockout mice showed a defective ability to adhere and spread on fibrinogen, in association with a dramatic reduction of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation and Akt phosphorylation. Pharmacological and genetic analysis demonstrated that integrin αIIbβ3 engagement selectively stimulated the β-isoform of PI3K (PI3Kβ), and that, as for Pyk2, PI3Kβ activation required Src family kinases activity, but not phospholipase Cγ2. In fibrinogen-adherent platelets, both Pyk2 and PI3Kβ were necessary for stimulation of the small GTPase Rap1b, a regulator of cell adhesion and spreading. Integrin αIIbβ3 engagement triggered the association of the PI3Kβ regulatory subunit p85 with the adaptor protein c-Cbl, which was mediated by the p85 SH3 domain, and was independent of c-Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation.

Real-time PCR was performed to assess SOSTDC1 and E4BP4 mRNA levels in MCF7, BT549, MBMDA231, T47D (breast cancer) and HEK293T (normal kidney) cell lines. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) were performed to assess the methylation level of the SOSTDC1 gene promoter, and 5-Aza 2-deoxycytidine (5'-Aza-dC) treatment was used to induce its demethylation. A luciferase assay was used to measure SOSTDC1 promoter activity in vitro. Stable shRNA-mediated knockdown of E4BP4 was carried out in MCF7 cells and confirmed by Western blotting. Finally, MCF7 cell proliferation and survival were measured by MTS assay.\nRESULTS: We found that SOSTDC1 is frequently down-regulated in primary breast cancers (98.2%) and in all breast cancer cell lines tested. MSP and BSP analyses revealed SOSTC1 promoter hypermethylation at CpG sites. 5'-Aza-dC treatment induced a striking down-regulation of SOSTDC1 gene expression, whereas BSP analysis showed demethylation of its promoter. Subsequent in silico SOSTDC1 promoter analysis indicated the presence of putative transcriptional repressor E4BP4 binding sites, and promoter deletion studies indeed revealed repressor binding regions encompassing these E4BP4 binding sites. Relative quantification of E4BP4 expression showed an inverse correlation to SOSTDC1 expression in the breast cancer cell lines tested. Exogenous over-expression of E4BP4 in HEK-293 and BT549 cells reduced SOSTDC1 expression and its promoter activity, respectively.

In this study, we focus on explaining the genome-wide approach that has led to most of these discoveries and discuss some of the early insights the new gene loci have provided into the aetiology of type 2 diabetes.\nRESULTS: Recent genome-wide association studies have provided an important resource for furthering our understanding of type 2 diabetes disease mechanisms. Genes previously unsuspected of playing a role in diabetes are now implicated in the disease process. These include genes in cell cycling control (CDKN2A/2B, CDKAL1), transcription factors (TCF7L2, HHEX), and ion channels (SLC30A8). These variants are all associated with insulin-secretory defects in the general population and show little if any relationship to insulin resistance.

After failure to pazopanib, patients have limited options for treatment. Therefore, subsequent therapy in patients who failed to pazopanib is urgently needed and the use of patient derived cells or patient derived tumors for accompanying testing with various pharmacological inhibitors could offer additional treatment options for these patients.\nMETHODS: Patient derived tumor cells were collected from ascites at the time of progression to pazopanib and a 13-drug panel was tested for drug sensitivity. We confirmed the results using in vitro cell viability assay and immunoblot assay.

NQO1 activity and mRNA expression were determined. The cells were pretreated with dicoumarol at relevant concentrations before treatment with gemcitabine. Cytotoxicity was determined by staining with fluorescent dyes. Oxidant formation was examined by assay of cellular glutathione levels and reactive oxygen species production by using dihydrofluorescein diacetate. Measurement of mitochondrial transmembrane potential was performed by using JC-1 fluorescent probe.

A cyclization recombination (Cre)/locus of X-over P1 (loxP) strategy was chosen to perform adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) invalidation in order to activate ectopic beta-catenin signaling in hepatoblasts; an appropriate transgenic model expressing the Cre recombinase was used. Phenotypic and immunolocalization studies, together with messenger RNA analyses, by microarray and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction approaches were performed on this model during normal hepatogenesis. The loss of Apc allowed beta-catenin activation in the hepatoblasts after the formation of the liver bud and led to embryonic lethality. In this model, the liver became hypoplastic, and hepatocyte differentiation failed, whereas beta-catenin-activated ducts developed and gave rise to fully differentiated bile ducts when transplanted into adult recipient livers.

However, little study has investigated its prognostic value in colorectal cancer (CRC).\nMETHODS: In our study, mRNA-NDUFA4L2 and protein expression were analysed in 150 cases of CRC and adjacent normal tissues using immunohistochemistry, semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The correlation between NDUFA4L2 expression and clinicopathological factors was evaluated by the Chi-square test. Overall survival of patients was analysed by the Kaplan-Meier method.\nRESULTS: NDUFA4L2 overexpression was observed in 84% (126/150) of CRC tissues, but only in 24.7% (37/150) of adjacent normal tissues (P < 0.05). Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed average mRNA expression levels to be 23.34 ± 1.356 and 4.34 ± 1.132 for CRC tissue and adjacent normal tissue (P < 0.05). Statistical analysis showed a significant correlation of NDUFA4L2 expression with histological grade, Dukes' stages, lymph node metastasis and liver metastasis. More importantly, multivariate analysis indicated that overexpression of NDUFA4L2 was an independent prognostic factor for CRC patients (P = 0.002). NDUFA4L2-negative patients had a higher tumour-free/overall survival rate than patients with high NDUFA4L2 expression (P = 0.001 and 0.002, respectively).\nQuestion: Is overexpression of NDUFA4L2 associated with poor prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

This study aimed at investigating PepT1 regulation by butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid produced by commensal bacteria and accumulated inside inflamed colonocyte.\nRESULTS: We found that butyrate treatment of human intestinal epithelial Caco2-BBE cells increased human PepT1 (hPepT1) promoter activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with maximal activity observed in cells treated with 5 mM butyrate for 24 h. Under this condition, hPepT1 promoter activity, mRNA and protein expression levels were increased as assessed by luciferase assay, real-time RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. hPepT1 transport activity was accordingly increased by approximately 2.5-fold. Butyrate did not alter hPepT1 mRNA half-life indicating that butyrate acts at the transcriptional level. Molecular analyses revealed that Cdx2 is the most important transcription factor for butyrate-induced increase of hPepT1 expression and activity in Caco2-BBE cells. Butyrate-activated Cdx2 binding to hPepT1 promoter was confirmed by gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Moreover, Caco2-BBE cells overexpressing Cdx2 exhibited greater hPepT1 expression level than wild-type cells.

TGF-β antagonists are showing promise in early-phase clinical oncology trials to neutralize the pro-oncogenic effects. However, there is currently no way to determine whether the tumor-suppressive effects of TGF-β are still active in human breast tumors at the time of surgery and treatment, a situation that could lead to adverse therapeutic responses.\nMETHODS: Using a breast cancer progression model that exemplifies the dual role of TGF-β, promoter-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and transcriptomic approaches were applied to identify a core set of TGF-β-regulated genes that specifically reflect only the tumor-suppressor arm of the pathway. The clinical significance of this signature and the underlying biology were investigated using bioinformatic analyses in clinical breast cancer datasets, and knockdown validation approaches in tumor xenografts.\nRESULTS: TGF-β-driven tumor suppression was highly dependent on Smad3, and Smad3 target genes that were specifically enriched for involvement in tumor suppression were identified.

In bryophytes representing basal lineage of land plants, there is little data regarding the mechanisms that control this transition. Two species from bryophytes - moss Physcomitrella patens and liverwort Marchantia polymorpha are under advanced molecular and genetic research. The goal of our study was to identify genes connected to female gametophyte development and archegonia production in the dioecious liverwort Pellia endiviifolia species B, which is representative of the most basal lineage of the simple thalloid liverworts.\nRESULTS: The utility of the RDA-cDNA technique allowed us to identify three genes specifically expressed in the female individuals of P.endiviifolia: PenB_CYSP coding for cysteine protease, PenB_MT2 and PenB_MT3 coding for Mysterious Transcripts1 and 2 containing ORFs of 143 and 177 amino acid residues in length, respectively. The exon-intron structure of all three genes has been characterized and pre-mRNA processing was investigated. Interestingly, five mRNA isoforms are produced from the PenB_MT2 gene, which result from alternative splicing within the second and third exon. All observed splicing events take place within the 5'UTR and do not interfere with the coding sequence. All three genes are exclusively expressed in the female individuals, regardless of whether they were cultured in vitro or were collected from a natural habitat. Moreover we observed ten-fold increased transcripts level for all three genes in the archegonial tissue in comparison to the vegetative parts of the same female thalli grown in natural habitat suggesting their connection to archegonia development.\nQuestion: Is female-specific gene expression in dioecious liverwort Pellia endiviifolia developmentally regulated and connected to archegonia production?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

Aspirin inhibits the synthesis of vasodilating prostaglandins, and, in principle, this inhibition might antagonize some of the effects of ACEi. But it is uncertain whether, in practice, this influences the effects of ACEi on mortality and major morbidity after MI.\nMETHODS: This overview sought individual patient data from all trials involving more than 1,000 patients randomly allocated to receive ACEi or control starting in the acute phase of MI (0-36 h from onset) and continuing for four to six weeks. Data on concomitant ASA use were available for 96,712 of 98,496 patients in four eligible trials (and for none of 1,556 patients in the one other eligible trial).\nRESULTS: Overall 30-day mortality was 7.1% among patients allocated to ACEi and 7.6% among those allocated to control, corresponding to a 7% (standard deviation [SD], 2%) proportional reduction (95% confidence interval 2% to 11%, p = 0.004). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was associated with similar proportional reductions in 30-day mortality among the 86,484 patients who were taking ASA (6% [SD, 3%] reduction) and among the 10,228 patients who were not (10% [SD, 5%] reduction: chi-squared test of heterogeneity between these reductions = 0.4; p = 0.5). Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor produced definite increases in the incidence of persistent hypotension (17.9% ACEi vs. 9.4% control) and of renal dysfunction (1.3% ACEi vs. 0.6% control), but there was no good evidence that these effects were different in the presence or absence of ASA (chi-squared for heterogeneity = 0.4 and 0.0, respectively; both not significant).

Elevation of circulating non-esterified (i.e. free) fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations can lead to insulin resistance and plays a central role in the development of metabolic diseases. Circulating NEFA in healthy individuals shows a marked diurnal variation with maximum levels occurring at night, yet the impact of sleep loss on NEFA levels across the 24 h cycle remains unknown. We hypothesised that sleep restriction would alter hormones that are known to stimulate lipolysis and lead to an increase in NEFA levels.\nMETHODS: We studied 19 healthy young men under controlled laboratory conditions with four consecutive nights of 8.5 h in bed (normal sleep) and 4.5 h in bed (sleep restriction) in randomised order. The 24 h blood profiles of NEFA, growth hormone (GH), noradrenaline (norepinephrine), cortisol, glucose and insulin were simultaneously assessed. Insulin sensitivity was estimated by a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test.\nRESULTS: Sleep restriction relative to normal sleep resulted in increased NEFA levels during the nocturnal and early-morning hours. The elevation in NEFA was related to prolonged nocturnal GH secretion and higher early-morning noradrenaline levels.

This study aimed to assess the value and use of cardiac myocardial perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (MPS) in patient selection prior to elective ICA.\nRESULTS: The rate of MPS within 90 days prior to elective ICA was assessed and the non-invasive test results were correlated with the presence of obstructive CAD on ICA (defined as stenosis of ≥50% of a major epicardial coronary vessel). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of obstructive CAD. A total of 7530 consecutive patients were included. At catheterization, 3819 (50.7%) were diagnosed as having obstructive CAD. Patients with a positive result on MPS (performed in 23.5% of patients) were significantly more likely to have obstructive CAD as assessed by ICA than those who did not undergo non-invasive testing (74.4 vs. 45.6%, P < 0.001).

Surgical subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsies were studied using quantitative PCR, immunohistochemistry, and a lipidomics approach to search for putative mediators of insulin resistance and inflammation. The groups were matched for age and BMI. The high LFAT group had increased insulin (P = 0.0025) and lower HDL cholesterol (P = 0.02) concentrations.\nRESULTS: Expression levels of the macrophage marker CD68, the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 were significantly increased, and those of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma and adiponectin decreased in the high LFAT group. CD68 expression correlated with the number of macrophages and crown-like structures (multiple macrophages fused around dead adipocytes). Concentrations of 154 lipid species in adipose tissue revealed several differences between the groups, with the most striking being increased concentrations of triacylglycerols, particularly long chain, and ceramides, specifically Cer(d18:1/24:1) (P = 0.01), in the high LFAT group.

We hypothesized that platelets may contribute to reperfusion injury and repair after normothermic hepatic ischemia. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of platelets in normothermic hepatic I/R injury using models of impaired platelet function and immune thrombocytopenia. Inhibition of platelet function in mice was achieved via clopidogrel feeding. Immune thrombocytopenia was induced via intraperitoneal injection of anti-CD41 antibody. Platelet-derived serotonin was investigated using mice lacking tryptophan hydroxylase 1. Mice were subjected to 60 minutes of partial hepatic ischemia and various time points of reperfusion. Hepatic injury was determined via AST and histological analysis of the necrotic area as well as leukocyte infiltration. Liver regeneration was determined via proliferating cell nuclear antigen and Ki67 immunohistochemistry. Neither inhibition of platelet function nor platelet depletion led to a reduction of I/R injury. Liver regeneration and repair were significantly impaired in platelet-depleted animals.

This work thus aims to better define the mast cell life cycle, with particular focus on new target structures for therapeutic or diagnostic approaches in allergy.\nMETHODS: Monoclonal antibodies were raised against degranulated cord blood-derived human mast cells. A subset of these antibodies that exclusively recognized degranulated mast cells, but did not cross-react with quiescent mast cells or other hematopoietic cell types, became key reagents in subsequent experiments.\nRESULTS: We identified a granular variant of tetraspanin CD63 as an exclusive molecular marker of degranulated human mast cells. Mutant analyses indicate that a cysteine cluster around residue C170 and protein glycosylation at residue N172 account for the antibody specificity. Here, we show that mast cells, which underwent an initial FcεRI-mediated degranulation, can be degranulated for at least another cycle in vitro. Repeated degranulation, however, requires an IgE/antigen stimulus that differs from the preceding one. Furthermore, the new variant-specific anti-CD63 antibodies effectively impair repeated cycles of mast cell degranulation.\nQuestion: Is a granular variant of CD63 a regulator of repeated human mast cell degranulation?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

Recent evidence suggests that soluble C5b-9 complexes (SC5b-9), which are readily detected in plasma during sepsis and have long been considered irrelevant nonmembrane binding end products of complement activation, may have numerous biologic effects. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine the effects of SC5b-9 on myocellular ion homeostasis and its mechanism(s) of action.\nMETHODS: Hindlimb fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus (EDL) was freshly isolated from rats weighing 50 to 70 g and then incubated at 30 degrees C for 60 minutes in normal Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB, pH 7.4) containing 10% zymosan-activated rat serum (10 mg/mL at 37 degrees C for 60 minutes) as a source of SC5b-9. Zymosan particles were removed by centrifugation after activation to exclude any noncomplement direct effects. Heat-inactivated rat serum (56 degrees C for 30 minutes) was used as control. EDL muscle was also incubated with pertussis toxin (1 microg/mL), in Ca(2+)-free KHB, with thapsigargin (0.3 or 3 micromol/L), or with ouabain (0.01, 0.1 or 1 micromol/L) before and/or during incubation with 10% zymosan-activated or heat-inactivated rat serum. Intracellular Na(+) and K(+) contents ([Na(+)](i) or [K(+)](i)) of EDL muscle were determined by using flame photometry after washing in ice-cold Na(+)-free Tris-sucrose buffer. SC5b-9 in zymosan-activated human serum was determined by SC5b-9 enzyme-linked immunoassay.\nRESULTS: SC5b-9 in zymosan-activated human serum significantly increased by 400% as compared with nonactivated, normal human serum. Zymosan-activated rat serum markedly increased [Na+]i without affecting [K(+)](i) in fast-twitch EDL muscle, which was completely inhibited by pertussis toxin, removal of extracellular Ca(2+) or depletion of intracellular Ca(2+) with thapsigargin. The addition of ouabain (at micromolar concentrations) increased myocellular [Na(+)](i) and decreased myocellular [K(+)](i) in both the zymosan-activated and the heat-inactivated rat serum groups.

Exosomes were characterized by flow cytometry and Western blot. Their capacity to induce IL-8 and LT production in the human bronchial epithelial cell (BEC) line 16HB14o- was measured by ELISA and reverse-phase HPLC, respectively.\nRESULTS: Compared to BALF exosomes from healthy individuals, BALF exosomes from asthmatics displayed higher levels of exosome-associated markers, such as the tetraspanins CD63 and CD81 and the scavenger receptor CD36. No major differences were observed between BALF exosomes from before and after allergen provocation. Furthermore, we show that BALF exosomes contain enzymes for LT biosynthesis.

The anterior fontanelle was assessed by three-dimensional ultrasound, with the midsagittal plane of the fetal head being the reference view for acquisition of the volume. Anteroposterior and laterolateral diameters, perimeter and area of the fontanelle were then measured offline; the diameters were normalized for biparietal diameter and the perimeter and area were normalized for head circumference. Non-parametric statistical analysis was used to compare the mean values of all variables in the two groups of fetuses. Intra- and interobserver variability were also assessed.\nRESULTS: All variables except the fontanelle laterolateral diameter were significantly greater in Down syndrome fetuses than in controls, with anterior fontanelle perimeter/head circumference and fontanelle area/head circumference ratios showing the highest sensitivity for the detection of Down syndrome. Using a cut-off of 2.1 for the fontanelle area/head circumference ratio, the sensitivity and specificity for the detection of Down syndrome were 77% and 96%, respectively.\nQuestion: Do fetuses with Down syndrome have an enlarged anterior fontanelle in the second trimester of pregnancy?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

The histone methyltransferases (HKMT) EZH2 and EHMT2 maintain the repressive chromatin histone methylation marks H3K27me and H3K9me, respectively, which are associated with transcriptional silencing. Although selective HKMT inhibitors reduce levels of individual repressive marks, removal of H3K27me3 by specific EZH2 inhibitors, for instance, may not be sufficient for inducing the expression of genes with multiple repressive marks.\nRESULTS: We report that gene expression and inhibition of triple negative breast cancer cell growth (MDA-MB-231) are markedly increased when targeting both EZH2 and EHMT2, either by siRNA knockdown or pharmacological inhibition, rather than either enzyme independently. Indeed, expression of certain genes is only induced upon dual inhibition. We sought to identify compounds which showed evidence of dual EZH2 and EHMT2 inhibition. Using a cell-based assay, based on the substrate competitive EHMT2 inhibitor BIX01294, we have identified proof-of-concept compounds that induce re-expression of a subset of genes consistent with dual HKMT inhibition. Chromatin immunoprecipitation verified a decrease in silencing marks and an increase in permissive marks at the promoter and transcription start site of re-expressed genes, while Western analysis showed reduction in global levels of H3K27me3 and H3K9me3. The compounds inhibit growth in a panel of breast cancer and lymphoma cell lines with low to sub-micromolar IC50s.

The NO2- and NO3- (metabolites of NO=NOx) concentration was measured by the Griess reaction. The iNOS gene expression was studied by RT-PCR.\nRESULTS: Four hours after LPS, BP of males (n=9) was reduced by 63+/-12 mmHg versus 10+/-4 in females (n=7, P<0.005).

In order to study hemodynamics and left ventricular (LV) and annular dynamics that determine suture tension, the central edge of the mitral leaflets was approximated with a miniature force transducer to measure leaflet tension (T) at the leaflet approximation point.\nMETHODS: Eight sheep were studied under open-chest conditions immediately after surgical placement of a force transducer and implantation of radiopaque markers on the left ventricle and mitral annulus (MA). Hemodynamic variables were altered by two caval occlusion steps (deltaV1 and deltaV2) and dobutamine infusion. Three-dimensional marker coordinates were obtained by simultaneous biplane videofluoroscopy to measure LV volume, MA area (MAA) and septal-lateral (SL) annular dimension throughout the cardiac cycle.\nRESULTS: At baseline, peak Alfieri stitch tension (0.30 +/- 0.18 N) was observed 96 +/- 61 ms prior to end-diastole coincident with peak annular SL diameter (98 +/- 58 ms before end-diastole). Dobutamine infusion decreased suture tension (from 0.30 +/- 0.18 N to 0.20 +/- 0.12 N, p = 0.01), although peak systolic pressure increased significantly (138 +/- 19 versus 115 +/- 14 mmHg; p = 0.03). A regression model was fitted with the goal of interpreting the hemodynamic and geometric predictors of tension as their influence varied with time: Tt (N) = 0.1916 + 0.2115 x SL (cm) - 0.1996 x MAA/SL (cm2/cm) + ft x LVP (mmHg), where Tt is tension at any time during the cardiac cycle and ft is the time-varying coefficient of LVP.\nQuestion: Does mitral annular size predict Alfieri stitch tension in mitral edge-to-edge repair?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

A special feature of V-O CEM that had to be considered was that it could be implanted in two physical states (as a viscous substance and a fully hardened material).\nRESULTS: The agar diffusion test showed that an antibacterial effect of freshly mixed V-O CEM was demonstrable for up to 60 min. In the microbial suspension test growth of E. coli was found to be promoted after 48-h incubation by V-O CEM set for 1 h. S. aureus exhibited a depressed growth, while Pseudomonas cultures demonstrated cell death after 48 h. V-O CEM set for 24 h and 7 days, respectively, exerted a similar though less pronounced effect. Using the microbial suspension test, a comparison was also made of the antibacterial activities of 24-h V-O CEM, bioactive glass ceramic and hydroxyapatite against cultures of S. aureus, Pseudomonas and E. coli. The inhibitory effect of hydroxyapatite on the growth of S. aureus was found to persist beyond the 48-h incubation period.

The mechanism of anti-angiogenic activity of thalidomide is not fully understood. As nitric oxide is involved in angiogenesis, we speculate a cross-talk between thalidomide and nitric oxide signaling pathway to define angiogenesis. The aim of present study is to understand the mechanistic aspects of thalidomide-mediated attenuation of angiogenesis induced by nitric oxide at the cellular level.\nMETHODS: To study the cellular mechanism of thalidomide-mediated blocking of angiogenesis triggered by nitric oxide, we used two endothelial cell based models: 1) wound healing and 2) tube formation using ECV 304, an endothelial cell line. These cell-based models reflect pro-angiogenic events in vivo. We also studied the effects of thalidomide on nitric oxide mediated egg yolk angiogenesis. Thalidomide could block the formation of blood vessels both in absence and presence of nitric oxide. Thalidomide effects on migration of, and actin polymerization in, ECV 304 cells were studied at the single cell level using live cell imaging techniques and probes to detect nitric oxide.\nRESULTS: Results demonstrate that thalidomide blocks nitric oxide-mediated angiogenesis in egg yolk model and also reduces the number of tubes formed in endothelial cell monolayers. We also observed that thalidomide arrests wound healing in presence and absence of nitric oxide in a dose-dependent fashion. Additionally, thalidomide promotes actin polymerization and antagonizes the formation of membrane extensions triggered by nitric oxide in endothelial cells. Experiments targeting single tube structure with thalidomide, followed by nitric oxide treatment, show that the tube structures are insensitive to thalidomide and nitric oxide.

However, conflicting results have prompted a debate regarding the beneficial effects of minocycline.\nMETHODS: In this study, we analyzed minocycline treatment in organotypic spinal cord cultures of neonatal rats as a model of motor neuron survival and regeneration after injury. Minocycline was administered in 2 different concentrations (10 and 100 µM) at various time points in culture and fixed after 1 week.\nRESULTS: Prolonged minocycline administration decreased the survival of motor neurons in the organotypic cultures. This effect was strongly enhanced with higher concentrations of minocycline. High concentrations of minocycline reduced the number of DAPI-positive cell nuclei in organotypic cultures and simultaneously inhibited microglial activation. Astrocytes, which covered the surface of the control organotypic cultures, revealed a peripheral distribution after early minocycline treatment. Thus, we further analyzed the effects of 100 µM minocycline on the viability and migration ability of dispersed primary glial cell cultures. We found that minocycline reduced cell viability, delayed wound closure in a scratch migration assay and increased connexin 43 protein levels in these cultures.\nQuestion: Does prolonged minocycline treatment impair motor neuronal survival and glial function in organotypic rat spinal cord cultures?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

Patients completed the SF-36 to measure QoL. In addition, transcriptome wide gene expression and 484 Single Nucleotide Polymorphysms (SNPs) in cytokine genes were available. QoL was first analyzed and associated with patient characteristics. Patients' physical QoL was impaired and weakly related with age and scoliosis, whereas mental quality of life (MCS) was normal. To explain a largely lacking correlation between disease severity and QoL, we related genome wide gene expression to QoL. Patients with lower MCS scores had high expression levels of CXCL9 and CXCL11 cytokine-related genes (p=0.001; p=0.002); similarly, patients with low vitality scores had high expression levels of CXCL9, CXCL11 and IFNA6 cytokine-related genes (p=0.02; p=0.02; p=0.04), independent of patient characteristics.

However, the mechanisms that control PDK1 have not been fully explored and this is of great importance as interfering with PDK1 signaling may be useful to treat diseases, including cancer and diabetes.\nRESULTS: In human cells, few mono-ubiquitinated proteins have been described but in all cases this post-translational modification has a key regulatory function. Unexpectedly, we find that PDK1 is mono-ubiquitinated in a variety of human cell lines, indicating that PDK1 ubiquitination is a common and regulated process. Ubiquitination occurs in the kinase domain of PDK1 yet is independent of its kinase activity. By screening a library of ubiquitin proteases, we further identify the Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 4 (USP4) as an enzyme that removes ubiquitin from PDK1 in vivo and in vitro and co-localizes with PDK1 at the plasma membrane when the two proteins are overexpressed, indicating direct deubiquitination.\nQuestion: Does ubiquitin-specific protease 4 inhibit mono-ubiquitination of the master growth factor signaling kinase PDK1?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

The frequency of CD4(+)FOXP3(+) cells and Foxp3 mRNA levels in the spleen of male NOD recipients were also quantified. In vivo cell homing was assessed by monitoring 5,6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labelled T cells or MSCs. In vitro, cell proliferation and cytokine production were assessed by adding graded doses of irradiated MSCs to insulin B9-23 peptide-specific T cell lines in the presence of irradiated splenocytes pulsed with the peptide.\nRESULTS: MSCs reduced the capacity of diabetogenic T cells to infiltrate pancreatic islets and to transfer diabetes. This protective effect was not associated with the modification of diabetogenic T cell homing, but correlated with a preferential migration of MSCs to pancreatic lymph nodes.

To determine whether circulating galectin-3 ligands are related to the presence of colon cancer, we sought to identify and quantify ligands in serum that bind to galectin-3.\nMETHODS: Sera from patients with colon cancer, adenomas, and normal individuals were desialylated, reduced, and separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and blots probed with biotinylated galectin-3.\nRESULTS: In colon cancer sera, the major galectin-3 ligand was a 40-kilodalton band distinct from mucin, carcinoembryonic antigen, and Mac-2 binding protein. Serum 40-kilodalton ligand was 10- to 30-fold higher in patients with colon cancer than in healthy subjects. Ligand was purified by gel filtration, affinity precipitation on galectin-3/agarose, and SDS-PAGE. When tryptic peptides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization mass spectrometry and protein database searching, the 40-kilodalton ligand was identified as haptoglobin beta subunit. In confirmation of this finding, depletion of haptoglobin by immunoprecipitation also eliminated the 40-kilodalton ligand. Colon cancer sera had only a modest increase in total haptoglobin as compared with healthy subjects, suggesting that the structure rather than the amount of haptoglobin is altered in patients with colon cancer.

Free progesterone and/or mannose ligands were compared for percent sperm binding and ability to induce an acrosome reaction. Western blots of sperm proteins localized to the plasma membrane and surface proteins precipitated following passive transfer of serum ASAs were probed with progesterone-horseradish peroxidase. The effects of the same ASAs on ligand binding and on the induced acrosome reaction were examined.\nRESULTS: The two receptors are located in close proximity on a subset of capacitated motile sperm and are coordinately cleared from the plasma membrane overlying the acrosomal cap prior to exocytosis. The surface appearance of functional binding sites for each ligand, however, is regulated by different mechanisms and the progesterone receptor alone is specifically precipitated by ASAs. Passive transfer of ASAs to capacitated sperm selectively inhibits the progesterone-stimulated acrosome reaction but not the ionomycin-induced acrosome reaction or the ability of sperm to bind mannose ligands.\nQuestion: Does co-expression of mannose-ligand and non-nuclear progesterone receptors on motile human sperm identify an acrosome-reaction inducible subpopulation?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

To date, the delivery of stem cells into myocardium has largely focused on implantation of cell suspensions.\nRESULTS: We hypothesize that delivering progenitor cells in an aggregate form would serve to mimic the endogenous state with proper cell-cell contact, and may aid the survival of implanted cells. Microwell methodologies allow for the culture of homogenous 3D cell aggregates, thereby allowing cell-cell contact. In this study, we find that the culture of cardiac progenitor cells in a 3D cell aggregate augments cell survival and protects against cellular toxins and stressors, including hydrogen peroxide and anoxia/reoxygenation induced cell death.

Recently, a Bax microsatellite mutation was uncovered in combination with a specific alternative splicing event that could generate a unique Bax isoform (BaxΔ2) in otherwise Bax-negative cells. Like the prototype Baxα, BaxΔ2 is a potent proapoptotic molecule. However, the proapoptotic mechanism and therapeutic implication of BaxΔ2 remain elusive. Here, the isolation and analysis of isogenic subcell lines are described that represent different Bax microsatellite statuses from colorectal cancer. Colon cancer cells harboring Bax microsatellite G7/G7 alleles are capable of producing low levels of endogenous BaxΔ2 transcripts and proteins. Interestingly, BaxΔ2-positive cells are selectively sensitive to a subgroup of chemotherapeutics compared with BaxΔ2-negative cells. Unlike other Bax isoforms, BaxΔ2 recruits caspase-8 into the proximity for activation, and the latter, in turn, activates caspase-3 and apoptosis independent of the mitochondrial pathway. These data suggest that the expression of BaxΔ2 may provide alternative apoptotic and chemotherapeutic advantages for Bax-negative tumors.\nQuestion: Does baxΔ2 promote apoptosis through caspase-8 activation in microsatellite-unstable colon cancer?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

If well-studied Mediterranean and eastern European refugia are widely accepted, some recent biogeographical assumptions still remain unclear, such as the occurrence of multiple glacial refugia in Iberia and cryptic refugia in northern Europe during the last glaciations. The Lusitanian snail Elona quimperiana has a remarkably disjunct distribution, limited to northwestern France (Brittany), northwestern Spain and the Basque Country. By describing the phylogeographical structure of this species across its entire range, the present study attempts to identify refugia and subsequent recolonization routes.\nRESULTS: Results based on 16S and COI gene sequences showed that the low genetic diversity observed in the Brittany populations should be associated with a recent demographic expansion. By contrast, populations from Spain exhibit several differentiated lineages and are characterized by demographic equilibrium, while the Basque populations are the only ones harboring typical distinct haplotypes. The center of the star-like networks of both gene sequences is occupied by a common ancestral-like haplotype found in Brittany and Spain, which might have originated from the middle of Northern Spain (i.e. Asturias, eastern Lugo and western Cantabria). Estimates of the divergence time between the Spain-Brittany and Basque lineages strongly suggest that E. quimperiana survived the Pleistocene glaciations in distinct refugia on the Iberian Peninsula, one of which is situated in Picos de Europa, and the other in the Basque Country.

PUVA is known to induce apoptosis in T lymphocytes collected by apheresis, however scarce information is available concerning the apoptotic pathways activated by PUVA.\nMETHODS: We used Jurkat human T leukemia cells and normal T lymphocytes to analyze the PUVA-triggered caspase activation pattern by means of immunoblot analysis, in vitro caspase activity assays, and selective caspase inhibitors coupled to flow cytometric analysis.\nRESULTS: PUVA treatment induced activation of apical caspases-9 and -8, and of effector caspases-3 and -7 in Jurkat cells and human T lymphocytes. While activation of caspase-9 occurred as early as 1 h after PUVA treatment of Jurkat cells, procaspase-8 cleavage was delayed and was detected 6 h after the exposure. Also in normal T lymphocytes, cleavage of caspase-8 was subsequent to activation of caspase-9. PUVA-dependent proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-8 was blocked by inhibitors selective for either caspase-9 or -3. Moreover, procaspase-8 was cleaved in vitro by activated caspase-3, which gave rise to proteolytic fragments equivalent to those generated in vivo.\nQuestion: Is caspase-9 the upstream caspase activated by 8-methoxypsoralen and ultraviolet-A radiation treatment of Jurkat T leukemia cells and normal T lymphocytes?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

The effect of FOXG1 on p21(WAF1/CIP1) transcriptional activity was examined by luciferase reporter assays. Cell lines stably expressing or short hairpin RNA interference-mediated knockdown FOXG1 were established for studying the gain-or-loss functional effects of FOXG1. XTT cell proliferation assay was used to measure cell growth of ovarian cancer cells.\nRESULTS: Quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analyses showed that FOXG1 was upregulated and inversely associated with the expression levels of p21(WAF1/CIP1) in ovarian cancer. The overexpression of FOXG1 was significantly correlated with high-grade ovarian cancer (P=0.025). Immunohistochemical analysis on ovarian cancer tissue array was further evidenced that FOXG1 was highly expressed and significantly correlated with high-grade ovarian cancer (P=0.048). Functionally, enforced expression of FOXG1 selectively blocked the TGF-beta-induced p21(WAF1/CIP1) expressions and increased cell proliferation in ovarian cancer cells.

Both positive and negative correlations have been found between CMS-associated orfs and the occurrence of CMS when CMS-associated orfs were expressed and targeted at mitochondria. Some orfs cause male sterility or semi-sterility, while some do not. Little is currently known about how mitochondrial factor regulates the expression of the nuclear genes involved in male sterility. The purpose of this study was to investigate the biological function of a candidate CMS-associated orf220 gene, newly isolated from cytoplasmic male-sterile stem mustard, and show how mitochondrial retrograde regulated nuclear gene expression is related to male sterility.\nRESULTS: It was shown that the ORF220 protein can be guided to the mitochondria using the mitochondrial-targeting sequence of the β subunit of F1-ATPase (atp2-1). Transgenic stem mustard plants expressed the chimeric gene containing the orf220 gene and a mitochondrial-targeting sequence of the β subunit of F1-ATPase (atp2-1). Transgenic plants were male-sterile, most being unable to produce pollen while some could only produce non-vigorous pollen. The transgenic stem mustard plants also showed aberrant floral development identical to that observed in the CMS stem mustard phenotype. Results obtained from oligooarray analysis showed that some genes related to mitochondrial energy metabolism were down-regulated, indicating a weakening of mitochondrial function in transgenic stem mustard.

Type IV pili (tfp) are polarly located filamentous structures which are the major adhesins for attachment of P. aeruginosa to epithelial cells. The extension and retraction of tfp powers a mode of surface translocation termed twitching motility that is involved in biofilm development and also mediates the active expansion of biofilms across surfaces. Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (eATP) is a key \"danger\" signalling molecule that is released by damaged epithelial cells to alert the immune system to the potential presence of pathogens. As P. aeruginosa has a propensity for infecting damaged epithelial tissues we have explored the influence of eATP on tfp biogenesis and twitching motility-mediated biofilm expansion by P. aeruginosa.\nRESULTS: In this study we have found that eATP inhibits P. aeruginosa twitching motility-mediated expansion of interstitial biofilms at levels that are not inhibitory to growth. We have determined that eATP does not inhibit expression of the tfp major subunit, PilA, but reduces the levels of surface assembled tfp. We have also determined that the active twitching zone of expanding P. aeruginosa interstitial biofilms contain large quantities of eATP which may serve as a signalling molecule to co-ordinate cell movements in the expanding biofilm.

Though they often co-exist, it is unclear whether depression and anxiety result from a shared pathological process. We studied the longitudinal course and determinants of depression and anxiety in PD in order to understand which factors contribute to the development of these symptoms.\nMETHODS: We conducted a prospective longitudinal study of 89 mild PD patients over 18 months, measuring depressive and anxiety symptoms at 6 monthly intervals using the Geriatric Depression Scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale--'Anxiety' subscale. Univariate and multivariate Generalised Estimating Equations were used to investigate the course of depression and anxiety and their association with demographic factors, motor measures, non-motor symptoms, and pharmacological factors.\nRESULTS: Depression and anxiety were co-morbid in 13.5% of the sample. Depressive symptoms remained relatively stable while anxiety symptoms improved over the course of 18 months. Severity of depressive symptoms was associated with female gender, motor fluctuations, apathy, and anxiety, while severity of anxiety was associated with older age, higher educational attainment, shorter disease duration, younger age of disease onset, and excessive daytime sleepiness.\nQuestion: Are depression and anxiety co-morbid but dissociable in mild Parkinson 's disease : A prospective longitudinal study of patterns and predictors?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

The implants used were the 185 mm2 Ahmed glaucoma valve and the 350 mm2 Baerveldt glaucoma implant. In terms of IOP, a complete success was defined as IOP of between 6 to 21 mm Hg without medication, qualified success as IOP between 6 to 21 mm Hg with one or more medication, and failure as a sustained IOP of >21 mm Hg or <6 mm Hg with or without one or more medication on two or more visits.\nRESULTS: A total of 32 combined phacoemulsification and glaucoma implant surgeries in 32 patients was performed.

Previously we found that estrogen aided in this neovasculogenesis via recruitment of bone marrow derived endothelial progenitor cells (BM-EPCs), leading to increased vessel formation and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production in vivo. However, the cellular mechanism of this induction and the signaling pathways involved need elucidation.\nRESULTS: Using the murine mammary cell line TG1-1 we observed estrogen (E2) lead to an up regulation of hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), an effect abrogated by the anti-estrogen Fulvestrant and the HIF-1 inhibitor YC-1 (3-(5'-hydroxymethyl-2'-furyl)-1-benzylindazole) suggesting the interchangeability of hypoxia and estrogen mediated effects. Estrogen modulation of HIF-1 and subsequent effects on endothelial cells is dependent on the Akt/PI3K pathway and protein synthesis as validated by the use of the inhibitors wortmannin and cycloheximide which abrogated estrogen's effects respectively. Estrogen treated TG1-1 cells secreted higher levels of VEGF which were comparable to secreted levels from cells grown under hypoxic conditions.

School closure was assumed to take place only once during the course of the pandemic, abruptly reducing child-to-child transmission for a fixed length of time and also influencing the transmission between children and adults. Public health effectiveness was measured by reduction in the cumulative incidence, and cost effectiveness was also examined by calculating the incremental cost effectiveness ratio and adopting a threshold of 1.0 × 10⁷ Japanese Yen/life-year.\nRESULTS: School closure at the epidemic peak appeared to yield the largest reduction in the final size, while the time of epidemic peak was shown to depend on the transmissibility. As the length of school closure was extended, we observed larger reduction in the cumulative incidence. Nevertheless, the cost effectiveness analysis showed that the cost of our school closure scenario with the parameters derived from H1N1-2009 was not justifiable.

Recently, based on the use of mutants blocked in autophagy, it has been demonstrated that autophagy is required for strict maternal inheritance in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Uniparental mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) inheritance has been well documented for numerous fungal species, and in particular, has been shown to be genetically governed by the mating-type loci in the isogamous species Cryptococcus neoformans, Phycomyces blakesleeanus and Ustilago maydis. Previously, we have shown that the a2 mating-type locus gene lga2 is decisive for UPI during sexual development of U. maydis. In axenic culture, conditional overexpression of lga2 triggers efficient loss of mtDNA as well as mitophagy. To assess a functional relationship, we have investigated UPI in U. maydis Δatg11 mutants, which are blocked in mitophagy.\nRESULTS: This study has revealed that Δatg11 mutants are not affected in pathogenic development and this has allowed us to analyse UPI under comparable developmental conditions between mating-compatible wild-type and mutant strain combinations. Explicitly, we have examined two independent strain combinations that gave rise to different efficiencies of UPI. We demonstrate that in both cases UPI is atg11-independent, providing evidence that mitophagy is not critical for UPI in U. maydis, even under conditions of strict UPI.\nQuestion: Is uniparental mitochondrial DNA inheritance affected in Ustilago maydis Δatg11 mutants blocked in mitophagy?", "answer": "No", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

Oral treatment with the recombinant L. lactis prior sensitization significantly prevented the development of airway inflammation in the Der p2-sensitized mice, as determined by the attenuation of inflammatory cells infiltration in the lung tissues and decrease of Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage. In addition, the serum allergen-specific IgE levels were significantly reduced, and the levels of IL-4 in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes cell cultures were also markedly decreased upon allergen stimulation in the mice fed with the recombinant L. lactis strains. These protective effects correlated with a significant up-regulation of regulatory T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes.\nQuestion: Do genetically engineered Lactococcus lactis protect against house dust mite allergy in a BALB/c mouse model?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

However, the supply of human hepatocytes is limited due to the shortage of suitable donor organs required to isolate high-quality cells. Human pluripotent stem cells reflect a potential renewable source for generating functional hepatocytes. However, most differentiation protocols use undefined matrices or factors of animal origin; as such, the resulting hepatocytes are not Good Manufacturing Practice compliant. Moreover, the preclinical studies employed to assess safety and function of human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived hepatocytes are generally limited to immunodeficient mice. In the present study, we evaluate the generation of hepatocytes under defined conditions using a European hESC line (VAL9) which was derived under animal-free conditions. The function capacity of VAL9-derived hepatocytes was assessed by transplantation into mice with acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure, a clinically relevant model.\nMETHODS: We developed a protocol that successfully differentiates hESCs into bipotent hepatic progenitors under defined conditions, without the use of chromatin modifiers such as dimethyl sulphoxide. These progenitors can be cryopreserved and are able to generate both committed precursors of cholangiocytes and neonate-like hepatocytes.\nRESULTS: Thirty days post-differentiation, hESCs expressed hepatocyte-specific markers such as asialoglycoprotein receptor and hepatic nuclear factors including HNF4α. The cells exhibited properties of mature hepatocytes such as urea secretion and UGT1A1 and cytochrome P450 activities. When transplanted into mice with acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure, a model of liver damage, the VAL9-derived hepatocytes efficiently engrafted and proliferated, repopulating up to 10 % of the liver. In these transplanted livers, we observed a significant decrease of liver transaminases and found no evidence of tumourigenicity. Thus, VAL9-derived hepatocytes were able to rescue hepatic function in acetaminophen-treated animals.\nQuestion: Does transplantation of hESC-derived hepatocytes protect mice from liver injury?", "answer": "Yes", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "biomedical_judgment_and_interpretation", "source": "one.libretexts"}}

In each patient diagnosed as having CD, thrombin generation was determined twice by means of calibrated automated thrombography. The first measurement was undertaken when CD was diagnosed; the second measurement was undertaken after normalization of their IgA antitissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG-Ab) titers following a gluten-free diet. In the controls, measurement for TTG-Ab and thrombin generation was undertaken once during recruitment.\nRESULTS: Patients with CD at diagnosis showed a significantly shorter lag time compared with controls (P < 0.001) and a shorter time-to-peak compared with controls (P < 0.02).

For fMRI, patients were scanned during visual presentation of faces representing different intensities of sadness. Clinical response was measured by change in serial scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Symptom change scores (and baseline symptom severity) were regressed on structural and functional MRI data to map brain regions where grey matter volume, or activation by sad facial affect processing, was significantly associated with symptom change (or baseline severity).\nRESULTS: Faster rates of symptom improvement were strongly associated with greater grey matter volume in anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and right temporo-parietal cortex. Patients with greater than median grey matter volume in this system had faster rates of improvement and significantly lower residual symptom scores after 8 weeks' treatment.

For this we utilized our recently developed tool, TACO. We performed this computational experiment in a cell-type-specific manner by utilizing cell-type-specific DNase-seq data for 105 human cell types. We also used 20 TRANSFAC motifs comprising not only the usual TFs constituting the enhanceosome but also the architectural proteins of High Mobility Group I(Y) (HMG I). A similar experiment used 42 DNase-seq data sets for mouse cell types. We found 137 statistically significant dimer predictions in the human genome, and 37 predictions in the mouse genome, that matched the positioning on the enhanceosome with ±2 bp tolerance. To characterize these predicted TF dimers, we performed functional analysis (Gene Ontology enrichment) for sets of genes which were in the neighbourhood of predicted dimer instances. A notable feature of these instances is that (1) most of them are located in introns of genes, (2) they are enriched in regulatory states, and (3) those instances that are located near transcription start sites are enriched for inclusion in computationally predicted enhancers.

Earlier studies have demonstrated poor physical fitness outcomes and a reduced level of physical activity for these children compared with their peers with normal motor skills.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine how physical fitness developed over time in 2 groups of children: those with a low level of competence in motor skills (low motor competence [LMC]), and those with a high level of competence in motor skills (high motor competence [HMC]).\nMETHODS: From an initial sample of 67 children, a group of 18 was identified as having HMC or LMC on the Movement Assessment Battery for Children and was selected for the present study. Eight children (3 girls and 5 boys) comprised the LMC group, and 10 children (4 girls and 6 boys) made up the HMC group. A longitudinal design was implemented, and physical fitness in the 2 groups was evaluated by measuring different fitness components over a period of 32 months.\nRESULTS: A mixed-effects analysis of variance revealed significant main effects for group and for time but no group x time interaction effect. The LMC group performed less well on all physical fitness measures than the HMC group, and both groups scored significantly higher on the physical fitness test after a period of 32 months.

However, the molecular mechanisms underneath the anti-cancer effect, if any, of these medicines have still remained unexplored. To this end we attempted to evaluate the efficacy of calcarea carbonica, a homeopathic medicine, as an anti-cancer agent and to delineate the detail molecular mechanism(s) underlying calcerea carbonica-induced tumor regression.\nMETHODS: To investigate and delineate the underlying mechanisms of calcarea carbonica-induced tumor regression, Trypan blue dye-exclusion test, flow cytometric, Western blot and reverse transcriptase-PCR techniques were employed. Further, siRNA transfections and inhibitor studies were used to validate the involvement of p53 pathway in calcarea carbonica-induced apoptosis in cancer cells.\nRESULTS: Interestingly, although calcarea carbonica administration to Ehrlich's ascites carcinoma (EAC)- and Sarcoma-180 (S-180)-bearing Swiss albino mice resulted in 30-35% tumor cell apoptosis, it failed to induce any significant cell death in ex vivo conditions. These results prompted us to examine whether calcarea carbonica employs the immuno-modulatory circuit in asserting its anti-tumor effects. Calcarea carbonica prevented tumor-induced loss of effector T cell repertoire, reversed type-2 cytokine bias and attenuated tumor-induced inhibition of T cell proliferation in tumor-bearing host. To confirm the role of immune system in calcarea carbonica-induced cancer cell death, a battery of cancer cells were co-cultured with calcarea carbonica-primed T cells. Our results indicated a \"two-step\" mechanism of the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells by calcarea carbonica i.e., (1) activation of the immune system of the host; and (2) induction of cancer cell apoptosis via immuno-modulatory circuit in p53-dependent manner by down-regulating Bcl-2:Bax ratio. Bax up-regulation resulted in mitochondrial transmembrane potential loss and cytochrome c release followed by activation of caspase cascade.

Many viral Large T Antigen (Tag) expression-related changes occurred in HUC-TC, and it is concluded that SV40 and 3-MC may act synergistically to transform cells. Changes noted in IFP 9-27, 2'-5' OAS, IF 56, MxA and MxAB were typical of those that occur in response to viral exposure and are part of the innate immune response.

We have previously developed an in vitro model using HepG2 liver-derived cells, which mimics changes in sIR levels in plasma from diabetic patients and shows that calcium-dependent proteases cleave IR extracellularly (a process known as shedding). The present study aimed to reveal the mechanisms of IR cleavage.\nMETHODS: Using the in vitro model, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of IR cleavage, which is accelerated by high-glucose treatment. We also analysed the relationship between IR cleavage and cellular insulin resistance, and the correlation between plasma sIR levels and insulin sensitivity, which was assessed by the euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp technique.\nRESULTS: Here, we determined that calpain 2, which is secreted into the extracellular space associated with exosomes, directly cleaved the ectodomain of the IRβ subunit (IRβ), which in turn promoted intramembrane cleavage of IRβ by γ-secretase. IR cleavage impaired insulin signalling and the inhibition of IR cleavage (by knockdown of calpain 2 and γ-secretase), restored IR substrate-1 and Akt, independent of IR. Furthermore, the glucose-lowering drug, metformin, prevented IR cleavage accompanied by inhibition of calpain 2 release in exosomes, and re-established insulin signalling.

We evaluated the mechanisms of cardiac glycosides, including digoxin, digitoxin and ouabain (Sigma®), on prostate specific antigen gene expression in vitro.\nMETHODS: We cultured LNCaP cells (ATCC®) and used them to determine the effect of cardiac glycosides on prostate derived Ets factor and prostate specific antigen expression. We determined prostate derived Ets factor and prostate specific antigen expression by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunoblot, transient gene expression assay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nRESULTS: Noncytotoxic doses (100 nM) of cardiac glycosides for 24 hours inhibited prostate specific antigen secretion by LNCaP cells. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot revealed that cardiac glycosides significantly down-regulated prostate specific antigen and prostate derived Ets factor expression. Transient gene expression assays showed that prostate derived Ets factor over expression enhanced prostate specific antigen promoter activity. However, prostate specific antigen and prostate derived Ets factor gene promoter activity was attenuated when LNCaP cells were treated with 100 nM cardiac glycosides.

Here, we investigated the phenotype of sFRP4 overexpression in an androgen-dependent prostate cancer model.\nMETHODS: An sFRP4-overexpressing androgen-dependent (LNCaP) prostate cancer model was established to assess changes in cellular proliferation, the expression, and subcellular localization of adhesion molecules and cellular invasiveness, and compared with the findings in sFRP4-overexpressing androgen-independent cells (PC3).\nRESULTS: sFRP4 overexpression in both cell line models resulted in a morphologic change to a more epithelioid cell type with increased localization of beta-catenin and cadherins (E-cadherin in LNCaP, N-cadherin in PC3) to the cell membrane. Functionally, sFRP4 overexpression was associated with a decreased rate of proliferation (P = 0.0005), decreased anchorage-independent growth (P < 0.001), and decreased invasiveness in PC3 cells (P < 0.0001).

The most sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for thyroid nodule diagnosis is fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy with cytological evaluation. Nevertheless, FNA biopsy is not always decisive leading to \"indeterminate\" or \"suspicious\" diagnoses in 10%-30% of cases. BRAF V600E detection is currently used as molecular test to improve the diagnosis of thyroid nodules, yet it lacks sensitivity. The aim of the present study was to identify novel molecular markers/computational models to improve the discrimination between benign and malignant thyroid lesions.\nMETHODS: We collected 118 pre-operative thyroid FNA samples. All 118 FNA samples were characterized for the presence of the BRAF V600E mutation (exon15) by pyrosequencing and further assessed for mRNA expression of four genes (KIT, TC1, miR-222, miR-146b) by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Computational models (Bayesian Neural Network Classifier, discriminant analysis) were built, and their ability to discriminate benign and malignant tumors were tested. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed and principal component analysis was used for visualization purposes.\nRESULTS: In total, 36/70 malignant samples carried the V600E mutation, while all 48 benign samples were wild type for BRAF exon15. The Bayesian neural network (BNN) and discriminant analysis, including the mRNA expression of the four genes (KIT, TC1, miR-222, miR-146b) showed a very strong predictive value (94.12% and 92.16%, respectively) in discriminating malignant from benign patients. The discriminant analysis showed a correct classification of 100% of the samples in the malignant group, and 95% by BNN.
