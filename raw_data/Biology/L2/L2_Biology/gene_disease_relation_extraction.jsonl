Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (multiplex PCR) and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) are the most common methods for detecting dystrophin gene mutations. This study aimed to contrast the two methods and discern the genetic characterization of patients with DMD/BMD in Eastern China.\nMethods: We collected 121 probands, 64 mothers of probands, and 15 fetuses in our study. The dystrophin gene was detected by multiplex PCR primarily in 28 probands, and MLPA was used in multiplex PCR-negative cases subsequently. The dystrophin gene of the remaining 93 probands and 62 female potential carriers was tested by MLPA directly. In fetuses, multiplex PCR and MLPA were performed on 4 fetuses and 10 fetuses, respectively. In addition, sequencing was also performed in 4 probands with negative MLPA.\nResults: We found that 61.98% of the subjects had genetic mutations including deletions (50.41%) and duplications (11.57%). There were 43.75% of mothers as carriers of the mutation. In 15 fetuses, 2 out of 7 male fetuses were found to be unhealthy and 2 out of 8 female fetuses were found to be carriers.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the seizure-like event (SLE) and inter-SLE states in a female MeCP2-deficient mouse model of Rett syndrome and compare them to those found in other spontaneous recurrent epilepsy models. The study was performed on a small population of female MeCP2-deficient mice using telemetric local field potential (LFP) recordings over a 24 h period. Durations of SLEs and inter-SLEs were extracted using a rule-based automated SLE detection system for both daytime and nighttime, as well as high and low power levels of the delta frequency range (0.5-4 Hz) of the recorded LFPs. The results suggest SLE occurrences are not influenced by circadian rhythms, but had a significantly greater association with delta power.

Using whole-genome sequencing in two first cousins with TAAD, we identified a missense mutation in the lysyl oxidase (LOX) gene (c.893T > G encoding p.Met298Arg) that cosegregated with disease in the family. Using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) genome engineering tools, we introduced the human mutation into the homologous position in the mouse genome, creating mice that were heterozygous and homozygous for the human allele. Mutant mice that were heterozygous for the human allele displayed disorganized ultrastructural properties of the aortic wall characterized by fragmented elastic lamellae, whereas mice homozygous for the human allele died shortly after parturition from ascending aortic aneurysm and spontaneous hemorrhage. These data suggest that a missense mutation in LOX is associated with aortic disease in humans, likely through insufficient cross-linking of elastin and collagen in the aortic wall.

We summarized their clinical features, analyzed laboratory parameters related to GS and SLC12A3 gene.\nRESULTS: The proband experienced intermittent severe symptoms of weakness accompanied by significant hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalciuria in laboratory test with poor treatments. His mother had more slight symptoms of weakness than him with mild hypokalemia and hypocalciuria. Mild hypomagnesemia was also observed in his sister with occasional weakness. All other pedigree members had normal laboratory test with no GS-related symptoms. A homozygous mutation of SLC12A3 gene (c.488C > T) was detected by genetic testing in three members, and six were carriers of this mutation.\nCONCLUSIONS: Genotype and phenotype vary significantly among GS patients.

It is due to loss-of-function hypomorphic mutations in the HSPG2 gene that encodes for perlecan, a proteoglycan secreted into the basement membrane. The origin of muscle stiffness in SJS is debated. To resolve this issue, we performed an electrophysiological investigation of an SJS mouse model with a missense mutation in the HSPG2 gene. Compound muscle action potential amplitudes, distal motor latencies, repetitive nerve stimulation tests, and sensory nerve conduction velocities of SJS mice were normal. On electromyography (EMG), neuromyotonic discharges, that is, bursts of motor unit action potentials firing at high rates (120-300 HZ), were constantly observed in SJS mice in all muscles, except in the diaphragm. Neuromyotonic discharges were not influenced by general anesthesia and disappeared with curare administration. They persisted after complete motor nerve section, terminating only with Wallerian degeneration. These results demonstrate that perlecan deficiency in SJS provokes a neuromyotonic syndrome. The findings further suggest a distal axonal localization of the generator of neuromyotonic discharges.

Mutations in alphaB-crystallin, desmin, myotilin, Zasp, or filamin-C can cause MFMs and were detected in 32 of 85 patients of the Mayo MFM cohort. Bag3, another Z-disk-associated protein, has antiapoptotic properties, and its targeted deletion in mice causes fulminant myopathy with early lethality.

Despite this fact, the origin of the albino mutation as well as the genetic basis of the hooded phenotype remained unclear. Recently, the albino mutation has been identified as the Arg299His missense mutation in the Tyrosinase gene and the hooded (H) locus has been mapped to the ∼460-kb region in which only the Kit gene exists. Here, we surveyed 172 laboratory rat strains for the albino mutation and the hooded (h) mutation that we identified by positional cloning approach to investigate possible genetic roots and relationships of albino and hooded rats. All of 117 existing laboratory albino rats shared the same albino missense mutation, indicating they had only one single ancestor. Genetic fine mapping followed by de novo sequencing of BAC inserts covering the H locus revealed that an endogenous retrovirus (ERV) element was inserted into the first intron of the Kit gene where the hooded allele maps. A solitary long terminal repeat (LTR) was found at the same position to the ERV insertion in another allele of the H locus, which causes the so called Irish (h(i)) phenotype. The ERV and the solitary LTR insertions were completely associated with the hooded and Irish coat patterns, respectively, across all colored rat strains examined. Interestingly, all 117 albino rat strains shared the ERV insertion without any exception, which strongly suggests that the albino mutation had originally occurred in hooded rats.", "answer": "(nan, nan, nan)", "type": "relation_extraction", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "gene_disease_relation_extraction", "source": "Bohrium"}}

Recent studies have reported loss-of-function mutations in the chloride channel 7 (CLCN7) gene as a cause of autosomal dominant osteopetrosis type II (ADO-II). The identification of gene mutations in Chinese with ADO has not been reported previously. In this study, we identified mutations of the CLCN7 gene in two unrelated Chinese families with ADO-II. Two probands with ADO-II were diagnosed based on their bone characteristics on X-rays and their laboratory results. All 25 exons of the CLCN7 gene, including the exon-intron boundaries, were sequenced. We found in family 1 that the proband (a 32-year-old woman) was heterozygous for a CLCN7 mutation. The nonsynonymous mutation consisted of a heterozygous C/T transition at codon 2327 in exon 24, which resulted in an arginine (CGG)-to tryptophan (TGG) substitution at position 767 (R767W). The same heterozygous mutation (C/T) was determined in her father and son, who were asymptomatic with normal skeleton radiography. In family 2, we found that the proband (a 17-year-old boy) carried a novel frameshift mutation (Glu798FS) resulting from a G insertion between codon 60 and codon 61 in exon 25. The heterozygous -/G insertion is predicted to elongate the peptide of CLCN7 by 120 amino acids after position 797 amino acids. Similarly, some individuals of this family carried the same heterozygous mutation, but they are all asymptomatic. Furthermore, the R767W and Glu798FS mutations were not found in 100 unrelated controls. Our present findings suggest that the novel Glu798FS mutation in exon 25 and R767W in exon 24 in the CLCN7 gene were responsible for ADO-II in these Chinese patients.", "answer": "(CLCN7, LOF, autosomal dominant osteopetrosis type II)", "type": "relation_extraction", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "gene_disease_relation_extraction", "source": "Bohrium"}}

Congenital lactase deficiency [CLD (MIM 223000)] is a severe gastrointestinal disorder and is characterized by watery diarrhea due to an extremely low or the lack of lactase activity in the intestinal wall from birth. CLD is a rare disease and occurs more frequently in Finland. Recent studies have shown that mutations in the coding region of the lactase (LCT) gene underlie CLD in patients from Finland and other European countries. Here, we report two novel mutations in the LCT gene in a Japanese female infant with clinical features consistent with those of CLD. She suffered from severe watery diarrhea from the age of 2 days on breast milk/lactose containing cow's milk formula. With the lactose-free hydrolyzed cow's milk formula, diarrhea was stopped, and she has now developed well on a lactose-free diet. She shows a lactose-intolerance pattern on the lactose challenge test.

Eye morphogenesis in humans involves a molecular genetic cascade in which a number of developmental genes interact in a highly organized process during the embryonic period to produce functional ocular structures. Among these genes, paired box gene 6 (PAX6) has an essential role as it encodes a phylogenetically conserved transcription factor almost universally employed for eye formation in animals with bilateral symmetry, despite widely different embryological origins. To direct eye development, PAX6 regulates the tissue-specific expression of diverse molecules, hormones, and structural proteins. In humans, PAX6 is located in chromosome 11p13, and its mutations lead to a variety of hereditary ocular malformations of the anterior and posterior segment, among which aniridia and most probably foveal hypoplasia are the major signs. Aniridia occurs due to decreased dosage of the PAX6 gene and exists in both sporadic and familial forms. The mutations are scattered throughout the gene and the vast majority of those reported so far are nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, or splicing errors that are predicted to cause pre-mature truncation of the PAX6 protein, causing haploinsufficiency.

Recently it was shown that the vast majority of patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II carry mutations in the SEC23B gene. Here we established the molecular basis of 42 cases of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II and attempted to define a genotype-phenotype relationship.\nDESIGN AND METHODS: SEC23B gene sequencing analysis was performed to assess the diversity and incidence of each mutation in 42 patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II (25 described exclusively in this work), from the Italian and the French Registries, and the relationship of these mutations with the clinical presentation. To this purpose, we divided the patients into two groups: (i) patients with two missense mutations and (ii) patients with one nonsense and one missense mutation.\nRESULTS: We found 22 mutations of uneven frequency, including seven novel mutations. Compound heterozygosity for a missense and a nonsense mutation tended to produce a more severe clinical presentation, a lower reticulocyte count, a higher serum ferritin level, and, in some cases, more pronounced transfusion needs, than homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for two missense mutations. Homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for two nonsense mutations was never found.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study allowed us to determine the most frequent mutations in patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II.

Incidence of RTT is mostly due to de novo mutation in the MECP2 gene (methyl-CpG-binding protein 2).\nMETHODS: The study assessed 27 female patients presented with classical RTT phenotype age range from 18 months to 48 months. Specialist carried out the clinical evaluation and diagnosis according to RTT diagnosis criteria. Blood samples from patients were then collected for genomic DNA extraction. We next performed MECP2 gene amplification and sequencing of the whole coding region to screen for mutations.\nRESULT: MECP2 mutation was found in 20 patients (74%) including: 2 missense, 4 nonsense, 6 frameshift and 2 deletion mutation. The study identified 14 pathogenic mutations which we found 4 mutation, to our knowledge and extensive search, not priory reported in any mutation database or publication: c.1384-1385DelGT, c.1205insT, c.717delC and c.1132_1207del77. High percentage of C > T (70%) in CpG sites mutation was found.\nCONCLUSION: Our result reveals a high percentage of C > T mutation in CpG hot spot, which is more prone to modification and more likely to be detected in RTT as a disorder is strictly due to de novo mutations.

We report here a patient who died from severe lethal hypophosphatasia, who was compound heterozygous for the mutation c.1133A>T (D361V) and the newly detected missense mutation c791A>G, and whose parents were both healthy. Because the c.1133A>T (D361V) mutation was previously reported to have a dominant-negative effect and to be responsible for the uncommon perinatal benign form of the disease, we studied the expression of the ALPL gene in this family. Analysis at the messenger RNA (mRNA) level, both quantitative and qualitative, showed that the paternal c.1133A>T (D361V) mutation was associated with over-expression of the ALPL gene and that the maternal c.791A>G mutation lead to complete skipping of exon 7. The results provide an explanation of the lethal phenotype in the patient where the two ALPL alleles are non-functional and in the asymptomatic father where over-expression of the normal allele could counteract the effect of the c.1133A>T (D361V) mutation by providing an increased level of normal mRNA.

Surprisingly, all four ADG-causing mutations identified to date disrupt a single conserved donor splice site adjacent to the 3' end of a noncoding exon and are predicted to result in haploinsufficiency for a skin-specific isoform of SMARCAD1. These data indicate a pivotal role for the SMARCAD1-skin specific isoform in dermatoglyph formation. In order to better understand the consequences of ADG-associated mutations, we ascertained the global transcription profiles of primary keratinocytes downregulated for SMARCAD1 and of patient-derived keratinocytes. A total of eight genes were found to be differentially expressed in both patient-derived and knocked down keratinocytes.

Previous studies showed that the recurrent PIGA germline mutation c.1234C>T (p.Arg412*) leads to a clinical phenotype at the most severe end of the spectrum associated with early infantile lethality. We identified three additional individuals from two unrelated families with the same PIGA mutation. Major clinical findings include early onset intractable epileptic encephalopathy with a burst-suppression pattern on EEG, generalized muscular hypotonia, structural brain abnormalities, macrocephaly and increased birth weight, joint contractures, coarse facial features, widely spaced eyes, a short nose with anteverted nares, gingival overgrowth, a wide mouth, short limbs with short distal phalanges, and a small penis.

Fibroblasts were used to measure mutant protein production. Subcellular localization and mobility of wild-type and mutant SATB2 were assessed using fluorescently tagged protein.\nRESULTS: Recurrent clinical features included neurodevelopmental impairment (19/19), absent/near absent speech (16/19), normal somatic growth (17/19), cleft palate (9/19), drooling (12/19), and dental anomalies (8/19).

Children affected with this disease tend to develop normally for the first 5 years of life. However, once disease onset occurs, they decline rapidly and die in their late 20s to early 30s. Though this represents the typical disease course, the onset and severity of disease symptoms can vary. This variability is presumed to be the result of both differences in the causative genetic mutation in the CLN3 gene as well as environmental influences. Most cases of JNCL are caused by a 1 kb deletion in the CLN3 gene, resulting in a frameshift mutation predicted to leave the first 153 amino acids of the CLN3 protein intact, followed by the addition of 28 novel amino acids. Here we report the discovery of a novel mutation identified as a G to T transversion at nucleotide 49 (G49T) in exon 2 of CLN3, introducing a premature stop codon (E17X) near the N-terminus.

The disease is caused by mutations in the ALDH3A2 gene (also known as FALDH and ALDH10) on chromosome 17p11.2 that encodes fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH), an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of long-chain aldehydes derived from lipid metabolism. In SLS patients, 72 mutations have been identified, with a distribution that is scattered throughout the ALDH3A2 gene. Most mutations are private but several common mutations have been detected, which probably reflect founder effects or recurrent mutational events. Missense mutations comprise the most abundant class (38%) and expression studies indicate that most of these result in a profound reduction in enzyme activity. Deletions account for about 25% of the mutations and range from single nucleotides to entire exons.

To date, no published studies have reported on mutations in the Mediterranean fever (MEFV) gene in patients with chronic periodontitis, although the roles of MEFV gene mutations in FMF and FMF-associated amyloidosis (FMF-A) are well known. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the frequencies of MEFV gene mutations and serum amyloid A (SAA) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels in patients with chronic periodontitis, FMF and FMF-A.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: The study population included 122 patients with FMF and 128 subjects who were systemically healthy. Clinical periodontal parameters, including the plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level and percentage of bleeding on probing were recorded. Blood samples were obtained from patients with FMF and systemically healthy controls, and all mutations located on exons 2 and 10 of the MEFV gene were analyzed by DNA Sanger Sequencing, which is the gold standard. SAA and high-sensitive CRP levels were also assessed.\nRESULTS: Mean gingival index, percentage of bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level, and the levels of SAA and hs-CRP were higher in the FMF-A group than those in the FMF and control groups. The two most relevant mutations in patients with FMF were heterozygous M694V (46.2%), and heterozygous R202Q (32.7%). The frequencies of the homozygous M694V and R202Q mutations in the FMF-A group were 53.8% and 46.1%, respectively. The complex R202Q/M694V homozygous state led to an increased risk of chronic periodontitis (odds ratio: 3.6), and FMF-A (odds ratio: 7.6).\nCONCLUSION: This is the first study to report the R202Q mutation in patients with periodontitis. Furthermore, the MEFV gene-mediated inflammatory pathway increased serum acute phase reactants, and the changes in the R202Q and M694V could play a role in inflammatory-genetic diseases, such as FMF, FMF-associated amyloidosis and chronic periodontitis.", "answer": "(MEFV, REG, chronic periodontitis), (MEFV, REG, familial Mediterranean fever)", "type": "relation_extraction", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "gene_disease_relation_extraction", "source": "Bohrium"}}

The aim of this study was to screen DNA samples from 16 Chinese MSUD patients and assess a potential correlation between genotype and phenotype.\nMETHODS: BCKDHA, BCKDHB and DBT genes were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing. Segments bearing novel mutations were identified by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis.\nRESULTS: Within the variant alleles, 28 mutations (28/32, 87.5%), were detected in 15 patients, while one patient displayed no mutations. Mutations were comprised of 20 different: 6 BCKDHA gene mutations in 4 cases, 10 BCKDHB gene mutations in 8 cases and 4 DBT gene mutations in 3 cases.

The purpose of this study was, by examining the electrophysiological responses of the retina, to evaluate the capacity of recovery of the whole retinal area and different cell types induced by extremely prolonged dark adaptation (DA) in BD disease and to gain further understanding of the pathogenesis of BD. Six young patients underwent bilateral full-field ERGs after 24 h of DA in one eye and standard DA in the fellow eye. The results were also compared with the effect of prolonged DA (10 h), previously studied in the same patients. After extremely prolonged DA (24 h) the rod b-wave and the mixed rod-cone a-wave responses reached normal though delayed amplitudes. An increase, up to normal level, in the oscillatory response was found. There was no obvious recovery of the cone response. We conclude that in young BD patients during extremely prolonged DA there is a significant additional capacity of recovery of rod function and also significant gain of activity in the inner retinal layer. A continuous but slow regeneration of rod photopigment seems to occur at least up to 24 h. The visual process in the RPE is retarded and CRALBP acts in this process; also, the Müller cells of the retina seem to be involved.

To assess the protective as well as the modulating affect of MEFV mutation carriage on various inflammatory disease states, we sought to define the frequency of MEFV mutations in Israeli Jewish individuals of various ethnicities, including those with low frequency of FMF, which were not in the focus of our attention hitherto. A total of 163 adults of Bucharian, Turkish, Georgian, Yemenite and Bulgarian origin comprised the study group. The prevalence of the most frequent MEFV mutations in the Israeli Jewish population, namely: M694V, V726A and E148Q, was assessed. The association of mutation carriage with a personal history of FMF-like phenomena, as well as various inflammatory and non-inflammatory diseases, was evaluated. A high MEFV mutation frequency was found among Jews of Bucharian, Georgian and Bulgarian origin (20%), whereas intermediate and low rates were detected in Jews of Turkish and Yemenite extraction (14 and 8%, respectively). FMF-like manifestations and related diseases were observed more often in MEFV mutation carriers than in their counterparts. MEFV mutation frequency, directly assessed by DNA analysis, exceeds the rate calculated from disease prevalence in Israeli Jewish individuals originated from ethnicities with a low prevalence of FMF.

PKAN is usually rapidly progressive, presenting in the vast majority in the first decade of life (classic form). A rarer, later onset and slowly progressive (atypical) PKAN form also exists. We present two siblings of Cypriot descent, a 27-year-old man and his clinically asymptomatic younger sister, both of whom were found to be homozygous for a novel c.695A>G (p.Asp232Gly) missense mutation in exon 2 of the PANK2 gene.

However, these methods are time-consuming, labourious, and limited in their application. Therefore, the development of new, more effective techniques is necessary.\nAIM: To detect the F8 and F9 gene mutations in patients with haemophilia and their female relatives in 29 haemophilia A (HA) and 11 haemophilia B (HB) families.\nMETHODS: \nFVIII: C and FIX:C were analyzed using one-stage method, and factor VIII and factor IX inhibitors were tested using the Bethesda method. Intron 22 and one inversions were identified using long-distance polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and standard PCR. Non-inversion mutations of the F8 and F9 gene were identified by targeted high-throughput sequencing. All mutations were verified by Sanger sequencing.\nRESULTS: Intron 22 inversion was detected in eight HA families and intron one inversion was detected in one HA family. Apart from the inversion mutations, 20 mutations were identified in HA families, including 17 previously reported and three novel mutations: c.5724G>A (p.Trp1908*), c.6116-1_6120delGAGTGTinsTCC (p.Lys2039Ilefs*13), and c.5220-2A>C. We found a complex rearrangement in HA: intron one inversion concomitant with exon one deletion. In HB, eight recurrent mutations were detected, including six missense mutations and two nonsense mutations.\nCONCLUSION: Targeted high-throughput sequencing is an effective technique to detect the F8 and F9 gene mutations, especially for the discovery of novel mutations.

Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia is clinically and genetically heterogeneous and six genes are associated with the phenotype of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 12-year-old Korean boy presented with intermittent knee pain. His height was 144.6 cm (20th percentile) and family history was notable for early-onset osteoarthritis in his father. The proband's x-rays revealed epiphyseal changes characteristic of multiple epiphyseal dysplasia associated with a collagen IX defect, with manifestations primarily restricted to the knees. Mutational analysis identified a novel c.104G>A substitution in exon 2 of COL9A3, resulting in p.Gly35Asp in the proband and his father. In silico analyses predicted the p.Gly35Asp amino acid change to be detelerious, and molecular dynamics simulation demonstrated a major structural change in the heterotrimeric collagen IX.\nCONCLUSION: So far, three COL9A3 mutations, have been reported. These three mutations are located at the splice donor or acceptor site of COL9A3 and cause skipping of exon 3, resulting in the deletion of 12 aminoacids in the COL3 domain of COL9A3.

Patients Choreoacanthocytosis was identified in 2 Mexican mestizo sisters with healthy consanguineous parents. Clinical manifestations began at different ages.\nRESULTS: The onset of signs and symptoms of CHAC in the proband was at age 32 years and was characterized by balancing problems followed by chorea, compulsive lip and tongue biting with buccolingual self-mutilation, dysarthria, dysphagia, and weight loss. The first clinical manifestations in the proband's sister occurred at age 45 years and included multiple motor and verbal tics, with coprolalia, followed by lip and tongue biting, self-mutilation, and chorea. The clinical findings in both sisters were remarkable for acanthocytosis that developed late, when neurologic changes were already evident.

Fifteen genetic subtypes of FA have been identified. Traditional complementation tests for grouping studies have been used generally in FA patients and in stepwise methods to identify the FA type, which can result in incomplete genetic information from FA patients.\nMETHODS: We diagnosed five pediatric patients with FA based on clinical manifestations, and we performed exome sequencing of peripheral blood specimens from these patients and their family members. The related sequencing data were then analyzed by bioinformatics, and the FANC gene mutations identified by exome sequencing were confirmed by PCR re-sequencing.\nRESULTS: Homozygous and compound heterozygous mutations of FANC genes were identified in all of the patients. The FA subtypes of the patients included FANCA, FANCM and FANCD2. Interestingly, four FA patients harbored multiple mutations in at least two FA genes, and some of these mutations have not been previously reported. These patients' clinical manifestations were vastly different from each other, as were their treatment responses to androstanazol and prednisone. This finding suggests that heterozygous mutation(s) in FA genes could also have diverse biological and/or pathophysiological effects on FA patients or FA gene carriers. Interestingly, we were not able to identify de novo mutations in the genes implicated in DNA repair pathways when the sequencing data of patients were compared with those of their parents.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that Chinese FA patients and carriers might have higher and more complex mutation rates in FANC genes than have been conventionally recognized.

Mutations are mainly truncating mutations or deletions, missense mutations having been reported in few cases. An important phenotypic variability is observed among gene carriers. To assess whether the phenotypic variability of neurofibromatosis 2 could be linked to genotype, clinical data of 154 patients whose NF2 germline alteration had been identified in our laboratory have been collected.\nMETHODS: A retrospective questionnaire was sent to the physicians in charge of these patients. Statistical analyses regarding genotypic and phenotypic data were performed by comparisons of average values and correlation tests.\nRESULTS: In French patients, type of mutation was correlated neither with patients' sex, nor with disease occurrence mode (de novo or inherited mutation). Disease associated with missense mutations occurred later, with a less severe symptomatology. Patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations were more frequently affected with meningiomas and spinal tumours, in addition to VIII nerve schwannomas, an observation that underlies the genetic determination of the number and type of NF2-related tumours.\nCONCLUSION: Results from the literature as well as from our study tend to show that only few correlations exist between genotype and phenotype in the NF2 disease. It also recognizes that missense mutations have a lower level of evolution, severity and mortality risk. Nonsense and frameshift mutations seem to be associated with a higher number of meningiomas and spinal tumours. Therefore, NF2 gene screening keeps its indications in both typical and moderate forms of the disease. Mutations are responsible of 80 p.cent of typical forms; in moderate forms, identification of a missense mutation seems linked to a lower disease evolution.

The present study reports the frequencies of MEFV mutations in 558 Lebanese and 55 Jordanian FMF patients and points out the severity of the M694V frequently observed mutation among these patients. Three novel mutations, T177I, S108R and E474K were also identified in the Lebanese group. An excess of homozygotes and a deficit of heterozygotes were observed in both samples when compared to the expected number of observed genotypes under the Hardy-Weinberg hypothesis. Homozygotes for M694V and M694I were still in excess in the Lebanese group of patients, even after consanguinous homozygotes were removed, or population structure was considered. This excess is therefore neither due to consanguinity nor to subgroups in the Lebanese population, but rather to more remote consanguinity or to a selection bias favoring the census of these genotypes. The fact that FMF female patients were less censed than male patients may be due to the greater resistance of females to pain and to the possibility of confusing abdominal and gynecological pain.

It has been shown that the disease is caused by cathepsin C gene (CTSC) mutation leading to the deficiency of cathepsin C enzymatic activity. This study demonstrates the clinical manifestations and CTSC mutational and enzymatic activity analyses in a 5-year-old Thai male PLS patient and his parents.\nMETHODS: Peripheral blood samples were obtained for genomic DNA isolation. All exons of the CTSC gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers. Mutations were identified by DNA sequencing. Verification of the mutation was performed by digestion of PCR products by restriction endonucleases. The cathepsin C enzymatic activity was determined using the synthetic substrate glycyl- L-arginine-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin.\nRESULTS: The patient demonstrated classical characteristics of PLS, including hyperkeratotic skin lesions. By the age of 5, all of his primary teeth were extracted due to severe periodontal infection. The parents had no physical abnormalities. The periodontal examination revealed localized mild periodontal destruction. Sequence analysis showed a nucleotide change at position 90 from C >A (c.90C >A) which resulted in a change from cysteine residue to a premature stop codon at the amino acid position 30 in the exon 1. The HpyCH4V digestion revealed that the patient was homozygous, whereas both the father and mother were heterozygous carriers of this mutation. The cathepsin C activity was reduced in the patient's mother, and the activity in the patient was almost completely lost.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate a CTSC gene mutation in a Thai family with PLS. The identified mutation is novel and potentially leads to the drastic reduction of the cathepsin C enzymatic activity. This suggests that the mutation is pathogenetic, causing the PLS.

Minimum criteria for inclusion in the adRP cohort included either evidence of at least three generations of affected individuals or two generations with evidence of male-to-male transmission. Probands from each family were screened for mutations in 13 genes known to cause adRP: CA4, CRX, FSCN2, IMPDH1, NRL, PRPF3 (RP18), PRPF8 (RP13), PRPF31 (RP11), RDS, RHO, ROM1, RP1, and RP9. Families without mutations in autosomal genes and in which an X-linked mode of inheritance could not be excluded were tested for mutations in ORF 15 of X-linked RPGR. Potentially pathogenic variants were evaluated based on a variety of genetic and computational criteria, to confirm or exclude pathogenicity.\nRESULTS: A total of 82 distinct, rare (nonpolymorphic) variants were detected among the genes tested. Of these, 57 are clearly pathogenic based on multiple criteria, 10 are probably pathogenic, and 15 are probably benign. In the cohort of 200 families, 94 (47%) have one of the clearly pathogenic variants and 10 (5%) have one of the probably pathogenic variants. One family (0.5%) has digenic RDS-ROM1 mutations. Two families (1%) have a pathogenic RPGR mutation, indicating that families with apparent autosomal transmission of RP may actually have X-linked genetic disease. Thus, 107 families (53.5%) have mutations in known genes, leaving 93 whose underlying cause is still unknown.\nCONCLUSIONS: Together, the known adRP genes account for retinal disease in approximately half of the families in this survey, mostly Americans of European origin. Among the adRP genes, IMPDH1, PRPF8, PRPF31, RDS, RHO, and RP1 each accounts for more than 2% of the total; CRX, PRPF3, and RPGR each accounts for roughly 1%. Disease-causing mutations were not found in CA4, FSCN2, NRL, or RP9. Because some mutations are frequent and some regions are more likely to harbor mutations than others, more than two thirds of the detected mutations can be found by screening less than 10% of the total gene sequences.

At age 6 years she was readmitted for severe ataxia and blindness, seizures, and severe developmental regression leading to NCL (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) suspicion. EEG showed slow background with IRDA (intermittent rhythmic delta activity). A conjunctive biopsy showed abnormal curvilinear and fingerprint lysosomal deposits, and genetic analysis revealed two heterozygous mutations of MFSD8 gene (c.881C > A p.Thr294Lys and c.754 + 2T > A) each inherited from carrier parents and a heterozygous variant (c.470A>C p.Asp157Ala) of CLN5 gene.\nCONCLUSION: NCL should be suspected and MFSD8 genetic testing should also be considered in patients with Rett like phenotype at onset and negative MECP2 mutation. Such cases should be carefully and frequently re-evaluated in order to avoid delayed diagnosis and offer proper genetic advice to the family.

Genes involved in metabolism, transport, cell wall modification, transcription and oxidative stress were differentially regulated between the two lines, under both control and Al stress treatments. Exposure to Al resulted in up-regulation of a large set of genes only in WT and not cbl1 shoots, while a different set of genes were down-regulated in cbl1 but not in WT roots. These differences allowed us, for the first time, to define a calcium-regulated/dependent transcriptomic network for Al stress responses.

The purpose of this study is to determine the role of targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) in the early diagnosis of BTHS in children with cardiomyopathy.\nMETHODS: During the period between 2012 and 2015, a gene panel-based NGS approach was used to search for potentially disease-causing genetic variants in all patients referred to our institution with a clinical diagnosis of primary cardiomyopathy. NGS was performed using the Illumina sequencing system.\nRESULTS: A total of 180 Chinese pediatric patients (114 males and 66 females) diagnosed with primary cardiomyopathy were enrolled in this study. TAZ mutations were identified in four of the male index patients, including two novel mutations (c.527A > G, p.H176R and c.134_136delinsCC, p.H45PfsX38).

The most important complication of FMF is secondary (AA) amyloidosis that leads to kidney failure. This study aimed to identify the frequency and distribution of MEFV mutations in Turkish patients with FMF-associated AA amyloidosis.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 57 patients with FMF-associated AA amyloidosis and 60 healthy controls were included in this study. We analyzed the MEFV gene for E148Q, M694V, M680I, and V726A mutations and R202Q variant by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism methods.  Results. The male-female ratio was 0.72. The mean age of the patients was 29.8 ± 12.8 years. Among the patients, the rate of the MEFV mutations was found to be 77.2%. The most frequently observed genotype was homozygous M694V mutation, which was present in 17 patients (29.8%, P < .001), followed by compound heterozygous M680I/M694V (14.3%, P = .01). The R202Q allele frequencies were significantly different between patients and control group (P = .02; odds ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.30 to 0.94).\nCONCLUSIONS: In this study, mutation analysis of MEFV gene confirmed that the most frequent mutation was homozygous M694V genotype.

Most of these mutations are characterized by DNA changes that lead to premature termination codons. We investigated 6 different PRPF31 mutations, represented by single-base substitutions or microdeletions, in cell lines derived from 9 patients with dominant retinitis pigmentosa. Five of these mutations lead to premature termination codons, and 1 leads to the skipping of exon 2. Allele-specific measurement of PRPF31 transcripts revealed a strong reduction in the expression of mutant alleles. As a consequence, total PRPF31 protein abundance was decreased, and no truncated proteins were detected. Subnuclear localization of the full-length PRPF31 that was present remained unaffected.

Although several genetic mutations have been linked to HPE, phenotypic outcomes range dramatically, and most cases cannot be attributed to a specific cause. Gene-environment interaction has been invoked as a premise to explain the etiological complexity of HPE, but identification of interacting factors has been extremely limited. Here, we demonstrate that mutations in Gli2, which encodes a Hedgehog pathway transcription factor, can cause or predispose to HPE depending upon gene dosage. On the C57BL/6J background, homozygous GLI2 loss of function results in the characteristic brain and facial features seen in severe human HPE, including midfacial hypoplasia, hypotelorism and medial forebrain deficiency with loss of ventral neurospecification. Although normally indistinguishable from wild-type littermates, we demonstrate that mice with single-allele Gli2 mutations exhibit increased penetrance and severity of HPE in response to low-dose teratogen exposure. This genetic predisposition is associated with a Gli2 dosage-dependent attenuation of Hedgehog ligand responsiveness at the cellular level. In addition to revealing a causative role for GLI2 in HPE genesis, these studies demonstrate a mechanism by which normally silent genetic and environmental factors can interact to produce severe outcomes. Taken together, these findings provide a framework for the understanding of the extreme phenotypic variability observed in humans carrying GLI2 mutations and a paradigm for reducing the incidence of this morbid birth defect.", "answer": "(GIL2, LOF, Holoprosencephaly )", "type": "relation_extraction", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "gene_disease_relation_extraction", "source": "Bohrium"}}

Although the missense mutation in PMP22 is rarely reported, it has been demonstrated to be associated with CMT. This study described a novel missense mutation of PMP22 in a Chinese family with CMT phenotype.\nMETHODS: Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to screen the causative genes in a family featured with an autosomal dominant demyelinating form of CMT. The potential variants identified by targeted NGS were verified by Sanger sequencing and classified according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics standards and guidelines. Further cell transfection studies were performed to characterize the function of the novel variant.\nRESULTS: Using targeted NGS, a novel heterozygous missense variant in PMP22 (c.320G>A, p.G107D) was identified. In vitro cell functional studies revealed that mutant PMP22 protein carrying p.G107D mutation lost the ability to reach the plasma membrane, was mainly retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, and induced cell apoptosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study supported the notion that missense mutations in PMP22 give rise to a CMT phenotype, possibly through a toxic gain-of-function mechanism.", "answer": "(PMP22, REG, Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease)", "type": "relation_extraction", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "gene_disease_relation_extraction", "source": "Bohrium"}}

The 23 common mutations of beta thalassaemia found in Chinese populations were detected by means of a reverse dot blot method.

Hypomorphic mutations in DONSON substantially reduce DONSON protein levels and impair fork stability in cells from patients, consistent with defective DNA replication underlying the disease phenotype.

Mutations in the SPAST (previously known as SPG4) gene that encodes the microtubule-severing protein called spastin, are the most common cause of the disease. The aetiology of the disease is poorly understood, but partial loss of microtubule-severing activity resulting from inactivating mutations in one SPAST allele is the most postulated explanation. Microtubule severing is important for regulating various aspects of the microtubule array, including microtubule number, length, and mobility. In addition, higher numbers of dynamic plus-ends of microtubules, resulting from microtubule-severing events, may play a role in endosomal tubulation and fission. Even so, there is growing evidence that decreased severing of microtubules does not fully explain HSP-SPG4. The presence of two translation initiation codons in SPAST allows synthesis of two spastin isoforms: a full-length isoform called M1 and a slightly shorter isoform called M87. M87 is more abundant in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues. Studies on rodents suggest that M1 is only readily detected in adult spinal cord, which is where nerve degeneration mainly occurs in humans with HSP-SPG4. M1, due to its hydrophobic N-terminal domain not shared by M87, may insert into endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and together with reticulons, atlastin and REEP1, may play a role in the morphogenesis of this organelle. Some mutated spastins may act in dominant-negative fashion to lower microtubule-severing activity, but others have detrimental effects on neurons without further lowering microtubule severing. The observed adverse effects on microtubule dynamics, axonal transport, endoplasmic reticulum, and endosomal trafficking are likely caused not only by diminished severing of microtubules, but also by neurotoxicity of mutant spastin proteins, chiefly M1.

Mutations in the genes encoding the six subunits of the IFT-A complex (IFT43, IFT121, IFT122, IFT139, IFT140, and IFT144) are known to cause skeletal ciliopathies, including cranioectodermal dysplasia (CED). As the IFT122 subunit connects the core and peripheral subcomplexes of the IFT-A complex, it is expected to play a pivotal role in the complex. Indeed, we here showed that knockout (KO) of the IFT122 gene in hTERT-RPE1 cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system led to a severe ciliogenesis defect, whereas KO of other IFT-A genes had minor effects on ciliogenesis but impaired ciliary protein trafficking. Exogenous expression of not only wild-type IFT122 but also its CED-associated missense mutants, which fail to interact with other IFT-A subunits, rescued the ciliogenesis defect of IFT122-KO cells. However, IFT122-KO cells expressing CED-type IFT122 mutants showed defects in ciliary protein trafficking, such as ciliary entry of Smoothened in response to Hedgehog signaling activation. The trafficking defects partially resembled those observed in IFT144-KO cells, which demonstrate failed assembly of the functional IFT-A complex at the base of cilia. These observations make it likely that, although IFT122 is essential for ciliogenesis, CED-type missense mutations underlie a skeletal ciliopathy phenotype by perturbing ciliary protein trafficking with minor effects on ciliogenesis per se.", "answer": "(IFT43, REG, cranioectodermal dysplasia), (IFT121, REG, cranioectodermal dysplasia), (IFT122, LOF, cranioectodermal dysplasia), (IFT139, REG, cranioectodermal dysplasia), (IFT140, REG, cranioectodermal dysplasia), (IFT144, REG, cranioectodermal dysplasia)", "type": "relation_extraction", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "gene_disease_relation_extraction", "source": "Bohrium"}}

CSNB is inherited as an autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or X-linked recessive trait and shows a good genotype-phenotype correlation. Clinically, CSNB is classified as the Riggs type and the Schubert-Bornschein type. The latter form is further sub-classified into complete and incomplete forms based on specific waveforms on the electroretinogram (ERG). There are no molecular genetic data for CSNB in the Indian population. Therefore, we present for the first time molecular profiling of eight families with complete CSNB (cCSNB).\nMETHODS: The index patients and their other affected family members were comprehensively evaluated for the phenotype, including complete ophthalmic evaluation, ERG, fundus autofluorescence, optical coherence tomography, and color vision test. The known gene defects for cCSNB, LRIT3, TRPM1, GRM6, GPR179, and NYX, were screened by PCR direct sequencing. Bioinformatic analyses were performed using SIFT and PolyPhen for the identified missense mutations.\nRESULTS: All eight affected index patients and affected family members were identified as having cCSNB based on their ERG waveforms. Mutations in the TRPM1 gene were identified in six index patients. The two remaining index patients each carried a GPR179 and GRM6 mutation. Seven of the patients revealed homozygous mutations, while one patient showed a compound heterozygous mutation.

Mutations in the AR gene cause androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), which is divided into subgroups according to the degree of undermasculinization.

One patient had a mutation (L7fsX33) that affects only the full-length AR-B form of the AR, whereas the other had a nonsense mutation (Q733X) affecting both isoforms.\nMEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We thoroughly analysed internal genitalia at surgery and by histological examination. No signs of Wolffian duct (WD) development were present in any of the patients. Western blotting of proteins from gonadal and genital skin fibroblasts was performed with AR antibodies directed against different AR epitopes.

An ophthalmic examination consisting of a fundus evaluation and electroretinography (ERG) was completed, and small aliquots of blood were collected from all participating individuals. Genomic DNA was extracted from white blood cells, and a genome-wide linkage or a locus-specific exclusion analysis was completed with polymorphic short tandem repeats (STRs). Two-point logarithm of odds (LOD) scores were calculated, and all coding exons and exon-intron boundaries of RP1 were sequenced to identify the causal mutation.\nRESULTS: The ophthalmic examination showed that affected individuals in all families manifest cardinal symptoms of RP. Genome-wide scans localized the disease phenotype to chromosome 8q, a region harboring RP1, a gene previously implicated in the pathogenesis of RP. Sanger sequencing identified a homozygous single base deletion in exon 4: c.3697delT (p.S1233Pfs22*), a single base substitution in intron 3: c.787+1G>A (p.I263Nfs8*), a 2 bp duplication in exon 2: c.551_552dupTA (p.Q185Yfs4*) and an 11,117 bp deletion that removes all three coding exons of RP1.

In order to find the causative genetic variant in this family, direct exon sequencing of the LDLR, APOB and PCSK9 genes was performed. We identified a compound heterozygous mutation in the proband with missense p.(W577C) and frameshift p.(G676Afs33) variants at exons 12 and 14 of the LDLR gene respectively. DNA sequencing of LDLR gene from the parents demonstrated that the missense variant was inherited from the mother and frameshift variant was inherited from the father. The frameshift variant resulted in a stop signal 33 codons downstream of the deletion, which most likely led to a truncated protein that lacks important functional domains, including the trans-membrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail domain. The missense variant is also predicted to be likely pathogenic and affect EGF-precursor homology domain of the LDLR protein. The segregation pattern of the variants was consistent with the lipid profile, suggesting a more severe FH phenotype when the variants are in the compound heterozygous state.

Cases of dominant inheritance and phenotype-genotype heterogeneity have been reported; however, the underlying molecular mechanism is not currently understood. The FMF protein named pyrin or marenostrin (P/M) is thought to be involved in regulating innate immunity but its function remains subject to controversy. Recent studies postulate that a defect in MEFV expression regulation may play a role in FMF physiopathology. Our group, along with others, has identified several alternatively spliced MEFV transcripts in leukocytes. Since alternative splicing and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathways are usually coupled in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, we hypothesized that NMD could contribute to the regulation of the MEFV gene. To address this issue, we examined the effect of indirect and direct inhibition of NMD on expression of the MEFV transcripts in THP1, monocyte and neutrophil cells. We showed that MEFV is the first auto-inflammatory gene regulated by NMD in both a cell- and transcript-specific manner. These results and preliminary western-blot analyses suggest the possible translation of alternatively spliced MEFV transcripts into several P/M variants according to cell type and inflammatory state.

We interrogated the unexplained transient absence of perinatal polycythemia observed in PFCP patients using an animal model of PFCP to examine its erythropoiesis during embryonic, perinatal, and early postnatal periods. In this model, we replaced the murine EpoR gene (mEpoR) with the wild-type human EPOR (wtHEPOR) or mutant human EPOR gene (mtHEPOR) and previously reported that the gain-of-function mtHEPOR mice become polycythemic at 3~6 weeks of age, but not at birth, similar to the phenotype of PFCP patients. In contrast, wtHEPOR mice had sustained anemia. We report that the mtHEPOR fetuses are polycythemic, but their polycythemia is abrogated in the perinatal period and reappears again at 3 weeks after birth. mtHEPOR fetuses have a delayed switch from primitive to definitive erythropoiesis, augmented erythropoietin signaling, and prolonged Stat5 phosphorylation while the wtHEPOR fetuses are anemic. Our study demonstrates the in vivo effect of excessive EPO/EPOR signaling on developmental erythropoiesis switch and describes that fetal polycythemia in this PFCP model is followed by transient correction of polycythemia in perinatal life associated with low Epo levels and increased exposure of erythrocytes' phosphatidylserine.

Previously we reported enhanced proliferative activity associated with the activation of WNT5A/CDK6/pRb signalling in PGRN-deficient cells. The objective of this work was to elucidate the association between PGRN deficiency, WNT5A signalling and cell proliferation in immortalized lymphoblasts from carriers of the c.709-1G > A GRN mutation (asymptomatic and FTLD-TDP).\nMETHODS: We assessed cell proliferation in carriers of the c.709-1G > A GRN gene mutation and controls without GRN mutation and without sign of neurologic degeneration by cell counting or using an MTT assay. We used a luciferase assay to measure the nuclear factor-κ (NF-κ) activity. We evaluated messenger RNA levels using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and protein levels by immunoblotting. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to analyze the interaction between PGRN and its receptors.\nRESULTS: We enrolled 19 carriers of the GRN gene mutation and 10 controls in this study. The PGRN-deficient cells showed increased expression of WNT5A due to NF-κB signalling overactivation. We observed a competition between PGRN and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) for binding both TNF receptors (TNFR) I and II.

An alternative analysis using a mixed-effects Cox proportional hazards model (COX-R) estimates a hazard ratio of exp(0.171), or about 1.19, for age of diagnosis between consecutive generations. LS-associated gene-specific anticipation effects are evident for MSH2 (2.6 years/generation for NREM and hazard ratio of 1.33 for COX-R) and PMS2 (7.3 years/generation and hazard ratio of 1.86).

DYSF gene analysis was performed by Sanger sequencing in 41 patients and targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) in 48 patients. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) was performed to detect exon duplication/deletion in patients with only one pathogenic mutation.\nRESULTS: Among the 89 index patients, 79 patients were demonstrated to carry two disease-causing (73 cases) or possibly disease-causing mutations (6 cases), including 26 patients with homozygous mutations. We identified 105 different mutations, including 59 novel ones. Notably, in 13 patients in whom only one pathogenic mutation was initially found by Sanger sequencing or NGS, 3 were further identified to carry exon deletions by MLPA. The mutations identified in this study appeared to cluster in the N-terminal region. Mutation types included missense mutations (30.06%), nonsense mutations (17.18%), frameshift mutations (30.67%), in-frame deletions (2.45%), intronic mutations (17.79%), and exonic rearrangement (1.84%).

Most imprinted genes form clusters, or imprinting domains, and are regulated by imprinting control regions. As imprinted genes have an important role in growth and development, aberrant expression of imprinted genes due to genetic or epigenetic abnormalities is involved in the pathogenesis of human disorders, or imprinting disorders. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a representative imprinting disorder characterized by macrosomia, macroglossia and abdominal wall defects, and exhibits a predisposition to tumorigenesis. The relevant imprinted chromosomal region in BWS is 11p15.5, which consists of two imprinting domains, IGF2/H19 and CDKN1C/KCNQ1OT1. BWS has five known causative epigenetic and genetic alterations: loss of methylation (LOM) at KvDMR1, gain of methylation (GOM) at H19DMR, paternal uniparental disomy, CDKN1C mutations and chromosomal rearrangements. Opposite methylation defects, GOM and LOM, at H19DMR are known to cause clinically opposite disorders: BWS and Silver-Russell syndrome, respectively. Interestingly, a recent study discovered that loss of function or gain of function of CDKN1C also causes clinically opposite disorders, BWS and IMAGe (intrauterine growth restriction, metaphyseal dysplasia, adrenal hypoplasia congenita, and genital anomalies) syndrome, respectively. Furthermore, several clinical studies have suggested a relationship between assisted reproductive technology (ART) and the risk of imprinting disorders, along with the existence of trans-acting factors that regulate multiple imprinted differentially methylated regions.

Clinical identification of low serum TNAP activity, dental abnormalities, and pedigree data strongly suggests a genotype-phenotype correlation between p.N440del and odonto-HPP in this family. Computational analysis of the p.N440del protein structure revealed an alteration in the tertiary structure affecting the collagen-binding site (loop 422-452), which could potentially impair the mineralization process.

The skin lesions evolve into a verrucous stage, followed by atrophy and scarring, leaving linear areas of hypopigmentation and hyperpigmented macules in bizarre patterns following Blaschko's lines. Systemic and neurologic complications include focal seizures and hemorrhagic cerebral infarction in infants, and retinal vasculopathy leading to blindness.

Alkaptonuria is invariably associated with HGD mutations, which consist of single nucleotide variants and small insertions/deletions. Surprisingly, the presence of deletions beyond a few nucleotides among over 150 reported deleterious mutations has not been described, raising the suspicion that this gene might be protected against the detrimental mechanisms of gene rearrangements. The quest for an HGD mutation in a proband with AKU revealed with a SNP array five large regions of homozygosity (5-16 Mb), one of which includes the HGD gene. A homozygous deletion of 649 bp deletion that encompasses the 72 nucleotides of exon 2 and surrounding DNA sequences in flanking introns of the HGD gene was unveiled in a proband with AKU. The nature of this deletion suggests that this in-frame deletion could generate a protein without exon 2. Thus, we modeled the tertiary structure of the mutant protein structure to determine the effect of exon 2 deletion. While the two β-pleated sheets encoded by exon 2 were missing in the mutant structure, other β-pleated sheets are largely unaffected by the deletion. However, nine novel α-helical coils substituted the eight coils present in the native HGD crystal structure.

The molecular diagnosis of ADPKD is complicated by extensive allelic heterogeneity and particularly by the presence of six highly homologous sequences of PKD1 exons 1-33. Here, we screened PKD1 and PKD2 for both conventional mutations and gross genomic rearrangements in up to 700 unrelated ADPKD patients--the largest patient cohort to date--by means of direct sequencing, followed by quantitative fluorescent multiplex polymerase chain reaction or array-comparative genomic hybridization. This resulted in the identification of the largest number of new pathogenic mutations (n = 351) in a single publication, expanded the spectrum of known ADPKD pathogenic mutations by 41.8% for PKD1 and by 23.8% for PKD2, and provided new insights into several issues, such as the population-dependent distribution of recurrent mutations compared with founder mutations and the relative paucity of pathogenic missense mutations in the PKD2 gene.

Hypoglycemia is common in CS neonates. A previously reported individual with the rare HRAS p.Gln22Lys had hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. Autopsy showed a discrete pancreatic nodule. The morphologic and immunohistochemistry findings, including loss of p57(Kip2) protein, were identical to a focal lesion of congenital hyperinsulinism, however, no KCNJ11 or ABCC8 mutation was identified and germline derived DNA showed no alternation of the maternal or paternal 11p15 alleles. Here we report paternal uniparental disomy (pUPD) within the lesion, similar to the pUPD11p15.5 in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). The similar extent of the pUPD suggests a similar mechanism driving hyperinsulinemia in both conditions. After coincidental somatic LOH and pUPD, the growth promoting effects of the paternally derived HRAS mutation, in combination with the increased function of the adjacent paternally expressed IGF2, may together result in clonal expansion. Although this somatic LOH within pancreatic tissue resulted in hyperinsulinism, similar LOH in mesenchymal cells may drive embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS). Interestingly, biallelic IGF2 expression has been linked to rhabdomyosarcoma tumorigenesis and pUPD11 occurred in all 8 ERMS samples from CS individuals. Somatic KRAS and HRAS mutations occur with comparable frequency in isolated malignancies. Yet, the malignancy risk in CS is notably higher than in Noonan syndrome with a KRAS mutation.

Further, telomere fluorescence in situ hybridization indicates that the abnormal signals, extra telomere signal and loss of telomere signal, emerge two- to three-fold more frequently in WS cells than in normal cells. Taken together, these results indicate that chromosome instability including dysfunction of telomere maintenance is more prominent in WS cells than in normal cells. In addition, the accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at the G(1) phase, including those at telomeres, detected by phosphorylated ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) foci is accelerated in WS cells even at a low senescence level. The increased accumulation of DSBs in WS cells is reduced in the presence of anti-oxidative agents, suggesting that enhanced oxidative stress in WS cells is involved in accelerated accumulation of DSBs.

Our objective was to report the clinical and electrophysiological characteristics of 18 CMT1C patients and compare them to 20 patients with PMP22 mutations: 10 CMT1A patients and 10 patients with hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP).\nMETHODS: Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1C patients were followed-up in referral centres for neuromuscular diseases or were identified by familial survey. All CMT1A and HNPP patients were recruited at the referral centre for neuromuscular diseases of Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital.\nRESULTS: Two phenotypes were identified amongst 18 CMT1C patients: the classical CMT form ('CMT-like', 11 cases) and a predominantly sensory form ('sensory form', seven cases). The mean CMT neuropathy score was 4.45 in CMT1C patients. Motor nerve conduction velocities in the upper limbs were significantly more reduced in CMT1A than in CMT1C patients. On the other hand, the motor nerve conduction velocity of the median nerve was significantly lower in CMT1C compared to the HNPP group. Distal motor latency was significantly more prolonged in CMT1A patients compared to the CMT1C and HNPP groups, the latter two groups having similar distal motor latency values. Molecular analysis revealed five new LITAF/SIMPLE mutations (Ala111Thr, Gly112Ala, Trp116Arg, Pro135Leu, Arg160Cys).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study delineates CMT1C as mostly a mild form of neuropathy, and gives clinical and electrophysiological clues differentiating CMT1C from CMT1A and HNPP.

Selected confocal images of corneal layers were evaluated qualitatively for shape and degree of light reflection of deposits.\nRESULTS: Novel mutations in the UBIAD1 gene (Y174C, K181R, and N233H) were identified. Additionally, cosegregation of the mutation (Y174C) and SCCD was confirmed in 1 pedigree, indicating that the mutation of the UBIAD1 gene is causative for SCCD. The 3 mutations were absent in all 200 control chromosomes. In vivo laser confocal microscopy demonstrated subepithelial highly reflective crystals in 4 cases; the shapes of the crystals were needle-shaped (3 cases) or rectangular (1 case).

Ectodysplasin is a homotrimeric transmembrane protein with an extracellular TNF-like domain, which has been shown to be involved in the morphogenesis of hair follicles and tooth buds during fetal development. Some human XHED patients also have concurrent immunodeficiency, due to mutations in the NF-kappaB essential modulator protein (IKBKG; formerly NEMO), which is also encoded on the X chromosome. In a breeding colony of dogs with XHED, immune system defects had been suspected because of frequent pulmonary infections and unexpected deaths resulting from pneumonia. To determine if defects in EDA or IKBKG cause XHED in the dogs, linkage analysis and sequencing experiments were performed. A polymorphic marker near the canine EDA gene showed significant linkage to XHED. The canine EDA gene was sequenced and a nucleotide substitution (G to A) in the splice acceptor site of intron 8 was detected in affected dogs. In the presence of the A residue, a cryptic acceptor site within exon 9 is used, leading to a frame shift and use of a premature stop codon that truncates the translation of both isoforms, EDA-A1 and EDA-A2, resulting in the absence of the TNF-like homology domain, the receptor-binding site of ectodysplasin.", "answer": "(EDA, LOF, X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia)", "type": "relation_extraction", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "gene_disease_relation_extraction", "source": "Bohrium"}}

Here, we present an unusual case of UPD in congenital severe factor (F) XIII deficiency. A 6-year-old girl experienced cephalhematoma and umbilical bleeding after birth and easy bruising, and postextraction bleeding since early infancy. FXIII activity was 0% [mother 53.7% and father 132.5% (normal 70-140%)] and the FXIII antigen level was 2.5% [mother 38.9% and father 151% (normal 75-155%)]. The washed platelet FXIII activity was 0.1% in the patient (normal 64-144%), suggesting a deficiency of FXIII-A subunit. The FXIII-A subunit genetic analysis detected a homozygous p.Arg382Ser mutation. A similar heterozygous mutation was detected in the mother but surprisingly, not in the father. Kinship was confirmed by a paternity test. To confirm the possibility of UPD, a test using four markers in the vicinity of the F13A1 gene revealed that she inherited duplicate mutations from a heterozygous mutation in her mother, presenting a unique case of unusual maternal segmental UPD in otherwise unexplained congenital (homozygous) severe FXIII deficiency.

Pancreatic ATP-sensitive K (KATP) channels are key regulators of insulin secretion and comprise Kir6.2 subunits coupled to sulfonylurea receptors. Because these channels are reversibly inhibited by cytoplasmic ATP, they link cellular metabolism with membrane excitability. Loss-of-function mutations in the pore-forming Kir6.2 subunit cause congenital hyperinsulinism as a result of diminished channel activity. Here, we show that several disease mutations, which disrupt intersubunit salt bridges at the interface of the cytoplasmic domains (CD-I) of adjacent subunits, induce loss of channel activity via a novel channel behavior: after ATP removal, channels open but then rapidly inactivate. Re-exposure to inhibitory ATP causes recovery from this inactivation. Inactivation can be abolished by application of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, an effect that can be explained by a simple kinetic model in which PIP2 binding competes with the inactivation process. Kir2.1 channels contain homologous salt bridges, and we find that mutations that disrupt CD-I interactions in Kir2.1 also reduce channel activity and PIP2 sensitivity. Kir2.1 channels also contain an additional CD-I salt bridge that is not present in Kir6.2 channels. Introduction of this salt bridge into Kir6.2 partially rescues inactivating mutants from the phenotype. These results indicate that the stability of the intersubunit CD-I is a major determinant of the inactivation process in Kir6.2 and may control gating in other Kir channels.", "answer": "(Kir6.2, LOF, congenital hyperinsulinism)", "type": "relation_extraction", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "gene_disease_relation_extraction", "source": "Bohrium"}}

Here we for the first time identified Ssq1 as an essential component for iron-sulfur cluster assembly in Candida albicans. Ssq1 played an important role in cell growth. Shutting off SSQ1 led to accumulation of intracellular iron, especially in mitochondria, and disorder of intracellular iron regulation. In tetO-SSQ1, iron overloading triggered the oxidative damage of mitochondrial function. Surprisingly, disruption of SSQ1 activated autophagic pathway. The mitochondrial dysfunction was further aggravated when CCZ1 (which is essential for autophagy) and SSQ1 was simultaneously deleted, suggesting that autophagy played a critical role in maintenance of mitochondrial function in tetO-SSQ1. In addition, double deletion of SSQ1 and CCZ1 further elevated cellular iron levels in comparison with tetO-SSQ1, indicating that autophagy participated in maintenance of iron homeostasis. Furthermore, we found that loss of SSQ1 led to increasing protein expression of Rnr1 and redistribution of Rnr2 from the nucleus to cytoplasm, and further resulted in cell cycle arrest. The results implied that cell cycle arrest was caused by activating the checkpoint pathway because of impairing the iron-sulfur cluster assembly in tetO-SSQ1. Shutting off SSQ1 led to a significant defect in filamentous development. Interestingly, the tetO-SSQ1ccz1Δ/Δ growth was inhibited on hyphae-inducing solid media. Both tetO-SSQ1 and tetO-SSQ1ccz1Δ/Δ exhibited extremely attenuated virulence, indicating that Ssq1 might provide a promising target for antifungal drugs development.

Lack of a C5a inhibitor activity in the peritoneum has previously been proposed in part to contribute in propagation of the serosal inflammation in FMF attacks. The aim of this study is to investigate C5a receptor (C5aR) gene polymorphism in patients with FMF and its relation to the main features of the disease. A polymorphism in the coding region of C5aR gene leading to C to T transition at nucleotide position 450 has been investigated in 85 non-related Turkish FMF patients and 160 non-related healthy controls by using PCR-RFLP. The frequencies of C5aR gene 450 CT genotype and T allele were not significantly different between Turkish FMF patients and healthy subjects (14.12 and 8.24% for FMF vs. 10 and 5% for controls, respectively). C5aR gene 450 CT genotype tended to associate with the presence Henoch-Schonlein purpura (OR: 1.25, 95% CI: 0.917-1.704, P = 0.017) but with no other clinical findings of the disease. C5aR polymorphism might be searched in populations having high prevalence of FMF.", "answer": "(MEFV, REG, Familial Mediterranean fever)", "type": "relation_extraction", "domain": "Biology", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_Biology", "subtask": "gene_disease_relation_extraction", "source": "Bohrium"}}

All the 11 coding exons and the flanking intron sequences of GNE gene were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Four family members of case 5 were also examined for GNE gene mutations.\nRESULTS: All the patients were identified to have different GNE gene mutations: Cases 1-4 had complex heterozygous mutations and case 5 had homozygous mutation. Six reported mutations had been identified, including 1 nonsense mutation (p.R8X) and 5 missense mutations (p.D176V, p.I298T, p.A591T, P.A631V, and p.V696M). A novel mutation (c.317T>C, p.I106T) was identified in case 2.\nCONCLUSION: This is the first report of p.R8X, p.I298T, p.A591T and p.V696M mutations in GNE gene in Chinese population, and a novel mutation p.I106T was identified.
