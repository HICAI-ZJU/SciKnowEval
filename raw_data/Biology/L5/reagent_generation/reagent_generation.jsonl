However, traditional protein tagging methods were cumbersome, inefficient, and often introduced unwanted sequences. My aim was to develop an efficient and precise protein tagging technique that avoids these pitfalls by combining type II and IIS restriction endonucleases. This novel approach would allow for the seamless integration of various tags into THSD1 or any gene of interest, enabling more in-depth biological analysis without the drawbacks of older methods.\nPlease design a list of materials, reagents, and equipment required for the experiment based on the user's needs.", "answer": "Materials and Reagents\n\n1.

The purpose of this experiment is to measure the efficiency with which BMDCs can engulf and remove necroptotic cells. By using flow cytometry, I aim to quantify this phagocytic activity in vitro. This would not only shed light on the efficiency of BMDCs in clearing necroptotic cells but also provide insights that could be applicable to other forms of cell death, thereby broadening our understanding of immune response dynamics in disease and therapy contexts.\nPlease design a list of materials, reagents, and equipment required for the experiment based on the user's needs.", "answer": "## Materials and Reagents\n\n1.

My motivation came from the observation that the T-box leader RNA forms a very stable stem-loop structure on its own, which has made it challenging to study its interaction with pre-formed tRNA using traditional *in vitro* methods. To overcome this challenge, I aimed to design an experiment that more closely mimics the natural conditions in the bacterial cell, where the tRNA exists in a pre-formed, stable state while the T-box leader RNA is being actively transcribed.
