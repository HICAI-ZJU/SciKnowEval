I aim to compare this new approach with the traditional intramuscular AAV delivery to assess its potential advantages.\nGive the materials, reagents, and equipment that may be required for the experiment, please design a detailed and step-by-step procedure for the experiment based on the user's needs:\n", "answer": "1. Anesthetize the adult mouse (2–3 months old; male or female) using an anesthetic vaporizer to administer an inhalation agent (e.g., isoflurane), preferably in a ventilated fume hood. Alternatively, use a small induction chamber/container for induction in accordance with institution guidelines, and minimize human exposure.\n2. Confirm surgical level of anesthesia by gently pinching the tail or paw with unserrated forceps. Do not proceed until the mouse is unresponsive to the pinch.\n3. Using a cotton-tipped applicator, generously apply ophthalmic ointment onto both eyes.\n4. Spray the fur along both hindlimbs with 70% ethanol to control the fur.\n5. Using a scalpel or an electrical rodent shaver, remove the fur on the hindlimb in an area extending from slightly below the knee up to the hip region.\n6. Disinfect the surgical area with an iodine containing solution (e.g., betadine). Wait for 15 s so that the applied betadine is dried on the skin.\n7. Orient the hindlimb in a slightly elevated position and secure with surgical tape onto underlying surface for optimal nerve exposure.\n8. Having located the knee joint and thigh bone (femur), make a small (approx. 3–5 mm) longitudinal incision in the dermal layer proximal to the knee joint with a scalpel.\n9. Further open the skin by blunt dissection using the tip of a pair of scissors.\n10. Now, carefully separate the muscle layer close to femur by blunt dissection with a pair of scissors, revealing the trifurcation site of the sciatic nerve, exposing approx. 5 mm of the nerve structure above and approx. 5 mm below the trifurcation site.\n11. Briefly vortex (approx 3–5 s) the freshly thawed aliquot of AAV particles and avoid repetitive pipetting.\n12. Keep the thawed AAV suspension on ice throughout the procedure.\n13. Aspirate desired volume ((in the range of 2–10 μL; ([Jan et al., 2019](#bib15); [Towne et al., 2009](#bib25))) with a filtered pipette tip.\n14. Using an unserrated forceps, gently open the separated muscles, then drop-wise (e.g., 1 drop every 2 s) apply the AAV suspension onto the sciatic nerve trifurcation site without touching the nerve.\n15. A co-worker may facilitate the rapid application of AAV, i.e., by loading the pipette with AAV suspension while the surgeon performs nerve exposure, and immediate muscle closure post-application, so that the risk of the exposed nerve becoming dry is minimized. In this manner, the step 14 of the procedure usually takes 5–10 s.\n16. Avoid repetitive touching of the nerve and do not insert any foreign material into the incision, e.g., under the nerve to restrict the diffusion of AAV solution as it may damage the delicate nerve tissue.\n17. Gently appose the muscle layers for approximately 10 s with the tip of an unserrated forceps. This allows for smooth diffusion of AAV particles around the nerve trunk.\n18. Close the skin wound using a veterinarian approved tissue adhesive (alternatively sutures).\n19. Inject an analgesic solution subcutaneously (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, NSAID), and apply a local analgesic (e.g., lidocaine) according to national and institutional guidelines.\n20. After returning the mouse into its home cage, monitor for approximately 2 h for any signs of unexpected discomfort and pain (restricted mobility, shivering, and vocalizations, biting the closed wound).\n21.

My goal was to use a two-way choice test to assess this behavior systematically.

Do not use CO2.\n3. Allow the larvae to grow for an additional 2—3 days. Add H2O as needed to ensure that the fly food remains moist.\n4. Scoop out food containing the larvae (~3—6 ml) into 40 ml of a 15% sucrose solution in a 50 ml tube. The food will sink and the larvae will float.\n5. After a brief incubation (~30—60 seconds), transfer the larvae (using a cut off P1000 pipet tip; diameter opening 5—8 mm) to a fresh 50 ml tube and wash the larvae with 15% sucrose until all remaining food debris is removed (usually 1—3 times).\n6.

Alternatively, uredospores of a determined isolate were propagated on plants under greenhouse conditions. Immediately after sampling, leaves were stored in a dry plastic or paper bag at room temperature up to four days. However, better results are expected from material recently collected or stored under refrigeration.  \n2. In the laboratory, uredospores were tapped off of the leaves into a suitable dry tube using a paint-brush, as shown in Video 2. This step should be done a short time before inoculation, that means, the time necessary to carry out 3-5 steps. The amount of uredospores depends on the amount of leaves that will be included in the experiment.  \n3. Fifty ml uredospore suspension was prepared using sterile distilled water, 1 drop of Tween 20 and uredospores to a final concentration of 1 x 105 spores/ml. The concentration of uredospores was estimated using a Neubauer chamber. The Tween 20 was added using a pipette, as shown in Video 3. Fifty ml solution can be used to infect approximately 50 leaves.\n4. Soybean transgenic and non-transgenic plants were cultivated in a plant culture room at 26 Â± 1 Â°C with a 16/8 h light/dark cycle at a light intensity of 22.5 ÂµE/m2/s. Fully expanded trifoliate leaves with similar size and position were collected from plants of the same age. The newest fully expanded leaf of 2-month-old plants (V5 or V6 stages) was preferentially used, but plants in other growth stages may be also used.\n5. From this step forward, the material was aseptically manipulated in a laminar flow cabinet. The leaves were rinsed (quick submersion) in sterile distilled water and rapidly dried on sterile filter paper. Each leaflet was cut into 5 cm x 5 cm pieces and individually placed with the abaxial side upwards in a sterile Petri dish (Ø 9 cm) containing filter paper saturated with distilled water to maintain high humidity.\n6. Each leaf piece was inoculated by spraying 1 ml of the uredospore suspension (105 spores/ml). The uredospore suspension was mixed immediately before each inoculation. A distance of 10 cm was maintained between the hand sprayer and the leaf piece.\n7. The Petri dishes were incubated in a growth chamber at 20 Â°C with a 12/12 h light/dark cycle for 12 days.\n8. The material was visually evaluated for the presence of lesions and pustules every 2 days during the incubation period.\n9. After 12 days of incubation, leaves showing signals of other diseases or rotting were eliminated. The remaining material was visually classified according to the lesion type (immune, reddish brown or tan) present on the abaxial side of the leaf. Additionally, the number of lesions, the number of lesions with pustules, the number of pustules per lesion, the total number of pustules and the total number of opened pustules present on each leaf piece was recorded under a stereomicroscope. Finally, two infected areas of 1 cm x 1 cm were determined in each leaf piece and cut off. Each 1 cm2 piece was placed in a microtube containing 500 Âµl water and vortexed vigorously for 1 min. The mean number of uredospores per cm2 was estimated under a stereomicroscope using a Neubauer chamber.\n10. Results obtained from each leaf piece were considered replicates.

Cut the remaining part of the leaf in small, equally sized pieces (e.g. 3 x 3 mm, pieces should easily fit into the wells of a 96-well plate). It is recommended that you cut about 2x to 3x more leaf pieces than you need.\n4. Float leaf pieces on the water in the petridishes (orientation does not matter), avoid submersion!\n5. Cover the samples and incubate overnight (or > 8 h) at room temperature, avoid shaking.\n6. Depending on the luminometer (single cell or multi-well plate reader) 90 Âµl water + 10 Âµl luminol master mix (10x) are pipetted into each well of a new 96-well plate. For single cell luminometers this might be scaled up 2x to 3x, according to the size of the measurement cuvette.\n7. Carefully add one leaf piece per well, avoid mechanical damage and wounding! If the pieces are very small one could also use two per well. Use a small spatula, no forceps! Check if all leaf pieces are in the center of the well prior to starting the measurement.\n8. Per planned treatment prepare about 3-4 replicates (each in an extra well); do not forget negative (e.g. untreated) and positive controls; all leaf pieces should have the equal size!\n9. Before the induction of a ROS-burst with MAMPs/elicitors, the background level has to be measured to ensure constant values of emitted light over time. Usually a measurement for about 5-10 min is sufficient to control for a stable non-oscillating baseline. If the baseline is not constant within this time the background measurement might be increased up to 60 min.\n10. Interrupt the background measurements and add your MAMP or any triggering substance (usually 1 Âµl) slightly shake plate horizontally on the table, and continue/re-start the measurement. The elicitors can be added by using an injector integrated in the machine, or by pipetting directly into the wells.

Bench top ultracentrifuge (e.g. Beckman Coulter, model: TL-100)\n2. Bench top centrifuge\n3. Sonicator\n4. Spectrophotometer", "answer": "1. The bacteria should be cultured in media appropriate for the bacterial species under investigation or the environmental condition being tested. Cultures can be at logarithmic or stationary phase, although stationary phase cultures can be harder to lyse for protein extraction.\n2. Harvest the bacteria by centrifugation at 6,708 *x g* for 10 min at 4 °C, discard the culture supernatant (unless it is needed to analyse secreted protein profiles).\n3. Wash the pellet by re-suspending it uniformly with buffer to a volume at 50 times that of the pellet (*e.g.* the pellet from a 200 ml stationary phase *E. coli* culture would be around 2 ml in volume and would need at least 100 ml of buffer), then re-centrifuge at 6,708 *x g* for 10 min at 4 °C. Repeat this wash step.\n4. For separation of *E. coli* membrane proteins the pellet should be washed in 10 mM Tris base (pH 7.5) (this buffer can be used with any proteins from any cellular source). For small volume culture protein fractionations (*e.g.* 25 ml) an overnight growth will give an OD600 of approximately 2; once harvested and washed, this would be re-suspended in 0.5-1 ml 10 mM Tris base (pH 7.5), to give a final cell density of OD600 of 20-30 (the suspension should have the appearance of pouring cream). For large volume culture (*e.g.* 200 ml) re-suspend in 5-10 ml 10 mM Tris base (pH 7.5). If proteolysis is likely to be a problem, a cocktail of broad spectrum protease inhibitors should be included at the levels recommended by the manufacturer.\n5. Freeze the culture suspension at -80 °C for 2 h or overnight to weaken the cell wall and increase the lysis of the bacterial cells by sonication.\n6. Thaw the bacterial suspension on ice and place it in a non-breakable plastic beaker sitting in an ice water bath. Set the sonicator between 6-8 microns and lyse the cells in cycles of 15 sec sonication followed by 45 sec cooling until the lysate changes from an opaque solution into a less turbid solution (usually 4-5 cycles are enough for log phase cells; stationary phase cultures may need more treatments).\n7. Centrifuge the lysed sample at 6,708 *x g* for 10 min at 4 °C to remove large debris fragments and unlysed cells (these will be contained in the pellet) and transfer the supernatant containing the total protein extract (membrane and cytoplasmic) into appropriate ultracentrifuge tubes.\n8. Ultracentrifuge the protein extract at 108,726 *x g* for 10 min at 4 °C to separate membrane proteins from cytoplasmic proteins.\n9. After the centrifugation the supernatant will contain the cytoplasmic proteins while the pellet contains the total membrane protein. If only a total membrane proteins fraction is required (comprising both inner and outer membrane proteins) then go to step 11, if only the outer membrane and inner membrane proteins fractions are required go to step 11 and then 10.\n10. The pellet consisting of total membrane proteins is re-suspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) supplemented with 2% Triton X-100 in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) (TT; *e.g.* for a small volume culture initially of 25 ml re-suspend in 100-200 µl of TT); the inner membrane proteins are solubilised by incubation at room temperature with occasional mixing for 30 min. The mixture is then again centrifuged at 108,726 *x g* for 10 min at 4 °C; the supernatant will contain the inner membrane protein fraction whereas the insoluble pellet will contain the outer membrane protein. To remove any residual inner membrane proteins, the outer membrane pellet is re-extracted for a further 30 min in 500 µl of TT (this step is only to purify the outer membrane proteins and so the supernatant should be discarded).   \n11. Wash the total membrane pellet twice or outer membrane pellet once in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5); for a small volume culture initially of 25 ml, 500 µl of buffer would be sufficient. Finally, re-suspend in 30-50 µl of the same buffer according to the membrane pellet size.\n12.

Notes: To avoid any potential rhythmic effects on stomatal aperture, sampling was always started at the same time of day and avoided at midday. For all treatments, the leaves at same developmental stage were always sampled. For each treatment, at least three leaves originated from different plants and at same developmental stage were harvested.\n2. For stomatal closing experiments, to ensure stomata at fully opened stage before starting of treatments, the fresh sampled flat leaves were first floated with their abaxial surfaces facing up on MES/KCl buffer in 6-cm diameter Petri plates for 2-3 h at 22 Â°C under light condition to open the stomata, and then for subsequent treatments.\n3. Once the stomata were fully open, the leaves were then floated on MES/KCl buffer alone or containing various compounds or inhibitors for required time at 22 Â°C under the same white light condition mentioned above or under the desired conditions. Control treatments involved addition of buffer or appropriate solvents used with inhibitors. Notes: For each treatment, at least three leaves originated from different plants were treated. As the epidermal strips is easier peeled from the abaxial surface than the paraxial surface of Arabidopsis leaves, we only peeled epidermal strips from abaxial surface of leaves for subsequent measurement of stomatal aperture. Thus, for treatments of UV-B radiation as well as other lights, to ensure the abaxial surface of leaves receiving same dose of UV-B radiation as well as other lights, the leaves were floated with their abaxial surfaces facing up and perpendicular to the light on MES/KCl buffer in all treatments including opening stomata.\n4.

Pregnant mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation at the appropriate gestation stage (midday of day 7 after appearance of a vaginal plug).\n3. After euthanizing the mother, 7.5 dpc (E7.5) mouse embryos (no allantoic bud (OB) - early allantoic bud (EB) stage, or OB/EB stage) were removed from decidua following the procedures described in “Manipulating the mouse embryo: a laboratory manual (Third Edition)” with minor modifications.\n4.

Hold the skin above and below the incision and expose the abdomen by pulling the skin toward head and tail. Cut the peritoneum with a watchmaker’s forceps and fine scissors.

For Gentamicin, we selected the following concentrations: 4mg/L and 12.5 mg/L.\n2. Prepare the antimicrobials. We used the same vials that are used in clinical practice.

My motivation was rooted in the hypothesis that subtle morphological changes in microglia could hint at early stages of neurological diseases or reveal unrecognized aspects of their role in healthy aging. The purpose of the experiment was to employ a refined tool, known as Microglial Sholl Analysis, that allows for a detailed comparison of microglia's complexity. By using confocal Z-projections with a single antibody on fixed brain tissue, I aimed to precisely quantify and visualize these changes in microglia morphology. This method is especially chosen for its effectiveness in capturing nuanced alterations, thereby providing insights that might contribute to understanding microglial involvement in brain health and disease better.\nGive the materials, reagents, and equipment that may be required for the experiment, please design a detailed and step-by-step procedure for the experiment based on the user's needs:\n1. 4% PFA fixed floating brain sections  \n2. 0.5% Triton in PBS  \n3.

(the right atrium is clipped with scissors shortly after perfusion to ensure effective clearing of the brain).\n3. Next infuse 25 mL of ice cold 4% PFA.\n4. Remove the brain and store in 4% PFA at 4 degrees C for 72 hours of post-fixation with gentle rocking in 20 mL scintillation vials.\n5. Remove excess PFA by dabbing the brain on a kimwipe and then transfer to a scintillation vial containing a 30% sucrose solution at 4 degrees.\n6.

Using the 63x objective on the confocal microscope, utilize the UV wide-field laser and DAPI fluorescence to select three fields from a given slice to represent that brain region. Three fields from each slice with three slices per mouse with at least three mice per experimental condition should be used to ensure a representative sampling of microglia (n > 30 microglia).\n22. Once the focus is set on the eyepieces, switch to the optimal laser for Iba1 fluorescence and range the z-stack on the microscope so that an entire microglia is located within the z-stack (~30 um per stack).\n23.

However, immobilizing these worms for such detailed optical recording has proven to be a significant challenge. Traditional methods like using microfluidic channels, anesthesia, or adhesion to slides have their downsides. My goal was to develop an innovative, efficient method to immobilize *C. elegans* that would allow us to optically record neuronal calcium dynamics, especially during olfactory stimulation, without compromising the integrity of the worms.

On a coverslip, add a small drop of 5% sodium alginate solution at room temperature and slightly spread it to make it sufficiently thick for the worms to immerse.\n4. Place the worms (one can add 1–4 worms per coverslip) in the sodium alginate layer.\n5. Allow the worms to settle for 2 min with minimum thrashing movements.

To the inside of the ring, add 100 µL of 100 mM CaCl2 (as the divalent ions) to polymerize the sodium alginate solution with the worm entrapped inside. Within 2–3 min, the sodium alginate will polymerize at room temperature.\n6. After polymerization, remove the plastic ring and wipe off the excess CaCl2 solution using filter paper. Alginate polymerization will occur around the worm, and the worms will show restricted movements.\n7.

My primary focus is on the Cyano-bacteriophage P-SSP7, a virus that infects cyanobacteria. Traditional methods to reconstruct virus structures often rely on imposing symmetry, which can obscure unique asymmetrical features critical for understanding virus-host interactions and the viral life cycle. Therefore, I aim to reconstruct the structure of Cyano-bacteriophage P-SSP7 without imposing any symmetry assumptions. This approach will allow us to uncover any potential asymmetrical structures that play roles in its infectivity and replication processes. By employing advanced techniques such as Multi-Path Simulated Annealing (MPSA) and a dynamic masking strategy, I wish to achieve a more accurate, detailed representation of the virus, paving the way for targeted antiviral strategies against such phages.\nGive the materials, reagents, and equipment that may be required for the experiment, please design a detailed and step-by-step procedure for the experiment based on the user's needs:\n1.

For asymmetric reconstruction, include the tail using a box size of 960 pixels, and then bin the images to 480 pixels (2.34 Å/pixel).\n3. Adjust centers of the particle images by 120 pixels in both X and Y directions due to increased box size and then shrink the adjusted center by a factor of 2 due to binning.\n4. Icosahedrally reconstruct an initial 3D model using the EMAN _make3d_ program with the modified list file and binned particle images.\n5. Lower the display threshold of the initial icosahedral map to visualize the tail and use Amira software to produce a tail mask from the ghost density.\n6. Add a positive constant to the 3D density to make the ghost tails visible in Chimera before applying the mask.\n7. Extract the initial tail model using the previously generated tail mask and low-pass filter the map using the _proc3d_ program in EMAN.\n8. Create a database of 2D tail masks for various orientations, optimizing the database by merging mask projections to reduce computational time.\n9. Generate 400 2D tail model reference projections and distribute this process across multiple CPUs using EMAN’s _runpar_ program.\n10.

This variability has made it hard to accurately assess their conformations during the early stages of folding in vivo. Hence, my goal was to develop a method that allows for the isolation of homogeneous ribosome-nascent-chain complexes with defined lengths from an E. coli cell-free transcription-translation system. This would potentially enable the precise characterization of nascent chain conformations as they emerge from the ribosome, providing insights into the earliest steps of protein folding in living systems.\nGive the materials, reagents, and equipment that may be required for the experiment, please design a detailed and step-by-step procedure for the experiment based on the user's needs:\n1. coupled transcription-translation _E. coli_ cell-free system (RTS100 _E. coli_ HY kit; Roche Applied Science)  \n2.

Subclone your gene of interest or truncations of it into pIVEX vector (Roche Applied Science) or in any T7-promoter based vectors (e.g., pET-system). The coding sequence of the protein of interest or its truncations should be extended C-terminally by the SecM-sequence (DYAHFTPQAKFxxxxWIxxxxGIRAGP) in order to stably stall the nascent chains on the ribosomes. The SecM should be linked to the protein or its truncations by a Gly-Ser-rich linker (preferably 13 amino acids long), which will ensure that the complete full-length nascent chain of interest is outside the ribosomal tunnel.  \n4.
