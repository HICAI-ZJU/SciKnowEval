The electronic transport properties of iron at high pressures and temperatures are pivotal in understanding Earth's core magnetic processes, as well as iron's phase transitions. For instance, the transition from the ambient ground-state body-centered cubic (bcc) structure to the high-pressure hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phase has been mapped via the pressure dependence of electrical resistance during shock compression. Garg et al. observed an abrupt increase in electrical resistance during this phase transition using a diamond anvil cell at up to 25 GPa in quasihydrostatic conditions. Recently, advanced experimental techniques have enabled measurements of electrical resistivity at much higher pressures and temperatures. Notably, Bi et al. conducted static measurements of iron's electrical resistivity under shock compression up to 208 GPa using an iron sample encapsulated in a single-crystal sapphire cell. Stacey and Loper estimated the electrical and thermal conductivities of iron at high pressures and under Earth’s core conditions. However, fundamental challenges remain, such as comprehending the pressure dependence of electrical resistivity and the sharp divergence between static and dynamic resistivity data in pressurized iron. To date, transport properties have received limited theoretical exploration. Zhang and Drabold developed expressions for electrical conductivity within a single-electron framework and perturbation theory using the principles of virtual work and coarse graining. Savrasov and Savrasov calculated the transport properties for several elemental metals using the low-order variation approximation (LOVA) and theoretical transport spectral distribution functions derived from _ab initio_ linear response calculations, which showed good agreement with experimental values. However, first-principles-based calculations specifically examining iron's electrical resistivity have not been previously reported. In this study, we apply theoretical techniques akin to those used by Savrasov et al. to both bcc and hcp iron, using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the exchange-correlation functional rather than the local density approximation (LDA), given that GGA provides better accuracy for many ground-state properties of iron.

As the quality of graphene improves and device dimensions are reduced, graphene is poised to become a key material for future electronic devices. Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) serve as fundamental structures from which graphene-based electronics can be developed. For instance, quantum dots within GNRs exhibit single electron charging signatures. Numerous device configuration proposals, including antidot superlattices, have been made. A minimal device example is a single atomic vacancy, which acts as the simplest possible antidot in a nanoribbon. A subsequent step involves two vacancies (antidots) forming a molecule within a nanoribbon, expected to produce complex transport fingerprints due to interactions between the antidots and the ribbon edges under magnetic fields or quasi-bound states in an antidot-defined potential landscape. The scenario in graphene is more complex due to new degrees of freedom arising from its monolayer carbon structure, which can be engineered at the atomic scale. The honeycomb lattice and distinct atomic orientations of zigzag and armchair edges in GNRs present novel possibilities for electronic property design, compared to conventional two-dimensional systems. This work aims to explore the transport fingerprints resulting from the interplay between geometric tailoring in two-dimensional layers and the unique properties of graphene at the atomic scale. Notable findings include tuning the coupling between localized states around vacancies and continuum states at edges, a concept enriched by the introduction of a new length scale when a magnetic field is applied. A possible imaging of the coupling strength is characterized by the line shape of Fano resonances, a concept originally discussed in atomic systems nearly fifty years ago. Recently, tuning Fano resonances in solid-state systems has become feasible and serves as a spectroscopy tool for investigating the underlying electronic structures in various electronic transport devices with multiple interfering channels. Though initially elusive in mesoscopic systems, Fano resonances have undergone substantial theoretical and experimental investigation. In Section II, basic aspects of the tight-binding approach and the lattice Green's-function method are mentioned. In Section III, the conductance and local density of states (LDOS) are calculated for zigzag and armchair GNRs with single vacancies. In Section IV, the conductance and LDOS are computed for GNRs with two vacancies, analyzing the effects of missing atom sublattices and vacancy separation with and without a magnetic field.

This configuration, resembling a B-A double vacancy, results in the conductance depicted by the continuous line in Fig. 3a. Here, an anti-resonance near the first conductance step is observed due to the high coupling of vacancies belonging to different sublattices, which creates bonding and antibonding energy states. This strong coupling effect also changes the line shape of the higher conductance steps. By moving the vacancy at the B sublattice to its left nearest neighbor, we obtain an A-A double vacancy with d_v = 0.73 nm. This subtle positional change significantly modifies the conductance line shape, resulting in a dip near the Dirac point, although the conductance does not reach zero, and there is an enhancement at higher steps. Examining the impact of increased vacancy distances, Fig. 3b shows the conductance for a B-A double vacancy with d_v = 2.6 nm, represented by the continuous line. Here, a typical asymmetric Fano line shape emerges in the first channel due to quantum interference between continuous and resonant states, characterized by |q| ≈ 1. In contrast, the dashed line in Fig. 3b, representing an A-A double vacancy with d_v = 2.7 nm, shows a broad, featureless conductance profile as the asymmetric Fano profile fades. As the distance between vacancies increases, their coupling decreases. In Fig. 3c, the continuous line represents a B-A double vacancy with d_v = 15.1 nm, exhibiting symmetric Breit-Wigner-type peaks indicative of resonant tunneling structures, where the continuum background is highly suppressed at the discrete state localization. Similarly, the dashed line in Fig. 3c, indicating a B-B double vacancy with d_v = 15 nm, reveals Breit-Wigner resonances shifted to lower energies. Both line shapes in Fig. 3c are similar due to the large inter-vacancy distances, resulting in weaker coupling primarily between each vacancy and the edge. This coupling transforms the separated defects into a single scattering center, similar to a double barrier resonant tunneling structure.\n Question: Based on the observations in the provided nanoribbon conductance study, what is the primary reason for the shift from an asymmetric Fano line shape to symmetric Breit-Wigner peaks as the distance between vacancies increases?", "choices": {"text": ["The increased distance between vacancies reduces their coupling, resulting in quantum interference effects being diminished and yielding resonant tunneling structures instead.", "The increased distance between vacancies results in constant conductance profiles regardless of interactions or positional changes.", "The increased distance between vacancies enhances their interaction with the edge, thereby maintaining a strong coupling effect.", "The increased distance between vacancies transforms one type of double vacancy into another, leading to consistent anti-resonance near the first conductance step."], "label": ["A", "B", "C", "D"]}, "answerKey": "A", "type": "mcq-4-choices", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_reasoning_and_interpretation", "source": "Material literatures"}}

Red identifies A-like sites, while blue designates B-like sites. In Fig. 4a, at the energy corresponding to the anti-resonance produced by a B-A double vacancy with a separation distance (\n d_{v}=0.61\nm), two peaks at distinct sublattices are clearly seen, with no significant change in the background LDOS at the edges, indicating weak coupling (\n q=0\between the localized and continuum states.

Introducing an additional scale, such as the scattering rate, further complicates the order of limits, providing a wide range of potential values. Experimentally, it is evident that the observed minima are not universal. Within a Boltzmann transport formalism, a scattering rate inversely proportional to energy can account for the observed linear dependence concerning carrier density. One possible source of such scattering is long-range Coulomb scatterers. While this theory works well for finite densities, the finite minimum conductivity requires new physics near the Dirac point. Based on the observation of charge inhomogeneity in this limit, a possible resolution is that Coulomb scatterers promote the formation of charge puddles.

These correlations transition from dynamic to static states as the temperature lowers to a point designated as T*, which represents a significant threshold where local distortions or phase transitions occur. This transition point is also where elastic diffuse scattering becomes perceptible in neutron spectra and marks the onset of relaxor behavior or frequency dispersion of the dielectric constant, leading to the adoption of the term 'polar nanodomains' (PND) for these polarized regions. The precise characteristics of these regions, including their shape, boundary nature, and surface energy, remain unclear. This study explores PNRs within the temperature range between T* and the Burns temperature, treating the relaxor as a binary system for simplification. We delve into a theoretical model that describes the interaction between transverse optic phonon (TO) scattering and PNRs, assuming a spherically symmetric PNR within an isotropic medium. The model presumes uniformity in all parameters, except for the phase transition temperature and the energy gaps of the soft-mode at zero momentum, across the PNR boundary. This analysis takes into account the mixing of transverse and longitudinal waves at the PNR boundary and incorporates the effect of polarization interaction with the electromagnetic field and longitudinal Coulomb forces. Interestingly, the study segregates elementary transverse excitations into vortex and quasi-polar categories, based on the nature of polarization lines within the system. The findings suggest that longitudinal optic (LO) waves, though potentially excited, largely remain confined to a superficial layer around the PNR due to their high energy gap which tempers their temperature dependence, underscoring a distinct behavior from critical transverse optic (TO) modes.\n Question: Based on the given text, which of the following inferences could best explain why longitudinal optic (LO) waves mostly remain confined to a superficial layer around the PNR?", "choices": {"text": ["The isotropic medium banishes LO waves to the superficial layer due to the uniformity in phase transition temperatures.", "LO waves transform into critical transverse optic modes upon reaching the PNR boundary, restricting their penetration depth.", "The high energy gap associated with LO waves limits their temperature dependence, preventing them from penetrating deeper into the PNR.", "LO waves interact more strongly with the electromagnetic field, causing them to aggregate at the PNR boundary."], "label": ["A", "B", "C", "D"]}, "answerKey": "C", "type": "mcq-4-choices", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_reasoning_and_interpretation", "source": "Material literatures"}}

We show that a local instability, referred to as 'phase transition in PNR', occurs at a temperature, denoted as Tc, which is equal to Tc2, where the mode frequency goes to zero locally, i.e., ω1 = 0. If Tc2 equals Tc1, Tc2 then represents the critical temperature for very large PNR. It is observed that Tc is lower for the case of a Vortex excitation compared to a QP excitation. Consequently, the QP condensation, or local phase transition, is expected to occur before the Vortex condensation upon cooling. Additionally, Tc is found to be lower for smaller PNR sizes. For Tc2 = Tc1, local TO modes can exist, where ω1 is less than ω0(1), due to reflection by the host medium. In the latter part of our paper, we calculate the Vortex and QP scattering by the PNR and identify strong resonance scattering at small TO momentum.

This can be attributed to the 'centrifugal barrier,' which results from the angular momentum contribution approximately proportional to [j+1]/R^2 in the Hamiltonian. The 'average' momentum corresponding to a given density of displacement is higher for a Vortex excitation compared to a QP excitation due to repulsion from the PNR center. To counterbalance the corresponding contribution to the free energy, the PNR must be supercooled below T_c2.

They are analogous to the different discrete levels corresponding to a given radial quantum number in quantum mechanics. The temperature dependence of the low frequency LM branch, \textit{ω\textsubscript{MM}}, can be explained as follows: The typical momentum inside the polar nanoregions (PNR) is proportional to \textit{b/R} (where \textit{b} is a numerical constant), and the LM excitation does not penetrate deeply into the host medium. Taking into account specific expressions, we can write the frequency of the LM as: \textit{ω\textsubscript{LMlf} ≈ √((b/R)\textsuperscript{2} + (a2)\textsuperscript{2} (T - T\textit{c2}))} or equivalently, \textit{ω\textsubscript{LMlf} ≈ a2√(T - T\textit{c2}\textsuperscript{*})}, with \textit{T\textit{c2}\textsuperscript{*} = T\textit{c2} - (b/(a2*R))\textsuperscript{2}}. Thus, the temperature dependence of the low frequency LM branch is similar to that of the soft-mode gap (where \textit{q} = 0) but with a smaller value of \textit{T\textit{c}}. The frequency of the local quasiparticle (QP) mode is smaller than that of the Vortex for two reasons: first, the QP wave field (\textit{j} = 1) contains a component with zero orbital momentum, and second, the QP mode interacts with the high energy longitudinal wave at the PNR surface. This interaction decreases the QP mode energy in accordance with the general results of second-order perturbation theory. Sample calculations for parameters such as \textit{R} = 12, \textit{j} = 1, \textit{T} = 140 K, \textit{ω\textsubscript{LMlf}} = 5.268, \textit{ω\textsubscript{LMlf}} = 7.028, \textit{ω\textsubscript{0}}(1) = 7.048, and \textit{ω\textsubscript{0}}(2) = 3.87 meV reveal a maximum of the low frequency LM displacement density at \textit{r} = 6.6 and only one node at the PNR center.

For instance, vortex peaks are smaller than quasi-particle (QP) peaks at temperatures of 130 K and 170 K, but not at 150 K. This can be observed by comparing Figures 7a and 7b. This phenomenon is attributed to the presence of quasi-local modes (QLMs) and local modes (LMs). The propagating incident transverse optical waves (TOW) can directly excite QLMs, resulting in strong resonant scattering. In contrast, such resonant scattering is not feasible with LMs since their energy is lower than that of the incident TOW. Generally, only shallow LMs significantly affect scattering. The difference in the impact of LMs and QLMs on scattering is corroborated by comparing the scattering for j=1 (Figure 9) with data shown in Figure 5, which is also calculated for j=1.

Notably, the pinning field observed is unidirectional, which is consistent with exchange bias as an interface effect. The bias acts as an effective volume unidirectional anisotropy when averaged by the Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) mode, appearing as a superposition with other volume anisotropies. This superposition becomes evident when measuring the bias at different orientations of the applied field relative to the bias field direction.

However, δ-O₂ shows a variety of magnetic structures with different stacking sequences of ab-planes, while α-O₂ shows only one stacking sequence (corresponding to HTC δ-O₂) across the entire range of temperature and pressure values. This observation can be explained by the competition between the interplane exchange interactions J_bc and J_ac. To clarify this point, we have plotted the intermolecular distances r_ac and r_bc as functions of the average intermolecular distances, represented by the volume v of the crystal unit cell. The distances r_ac and r_bc were calculated using measurements of temperature and pressure dependencies taken from different regions of the solid oxygen phase diagram, including α- and δ-phases. It can be clearly seen that in α-O₂, the distance r_ac is greater than r_bc with a difference of approximately 20%. Considering the spatial and angular dependencies of J(r,θ), it can be assumed that J_bc is less than J_ac, making HTC ordering energetically favorable. At the α→δ transition point, the dependence r_ac(v) shows a step-like decrease. Consequently, the relative difference between r_ac and r_bc diminishes to approximately 7.5%. The corresponding difference between J_bc and J_ac can be compensated due to the strong angular dependence of J(r,θ), which becomes crucial at small intermolecular distances.

The magnetic anisotropy of GaMnAs has previously been adjusted quasi-statically through strain by growth engineering or by attaching strain actuators onto the layer.\n Question: Based on the text, what is a primary reason for exploring picosecond acoustic strain pulses (ps-ASP) in modulating GaMnAs magnetism?", "choices": {"text": ["To investigate the effects of long-term thermal modulation on GaMnAs magnetism.", "To replace thermal modulation methods with slower mechanical methods.", "To increase the Curie temperature beyond 200 K.", "The goal is to achieve ultra-fast switching similar to that used in ferromagnetic metals."], "label": ["A", "B", "C", "D"]}, "answerKey": "D", "type": "mcq-4-choices", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_reasoning_and_interpretation", "source": "Material literatures"}}

Another Ti:Sapphire laser delivers 80 fs pulses at a frequency slightly different from the pump frequency. These pulses are used to detect the acoustic strain pulse after its propagation through the substrate or to observe the magnetization change induced by the strain pulse on the front-side GaMnAsP layer. This asynchronous optical sampling scheme, based on the stroboscopic effect, has been recently implemented in a picosecond acoustic experiment.

The probe beam, which was linearly polarized, had a fluence of 10 \textmu J/cm\textsuperscript{-2} and was focused to a spot size comparable to the pump spot size. Prior studies have established that the phase change is predominantly due to surface displacement. Consequently, the incoming strain can be determined by considering acoustic reflection on the Al layer. The calculated strain pulse impacting the GaMnAsP layers, depicted in Fig. 1b (gray line), exhibits the typical characteristics observed in non-linear picosecond acoustics, including two acoustic solitons at the front and an oscillating tail. The pump spot size was such that diffraction effects during propagation were negligible. By fitting the incoming picosecond acoustic strain pulse (ps-ASP) with a non-linear propagation equation, the soliton amplitude was found to be approximately 8.4 \times 10^{-4} for a pump fluence of 280 \textmu J/cm\textsuperscript{-2} at 58 K. This maximum accessible strain is slightly lower than the static piezo-induced uniaxial strain reported by Bihler et al., but it occurs over a much shorter timescale of about 2-10 ps. The strain spectrum, shown as an inset in Fig. 1b, is typically broad (spanning over 300 GHz) with slight modulations due to non-linear effects. The higher frequencies are mainly cut off due to time jitter and pump-probe spatial averaging.

Frequencies below 50 GHz are barely affected by sound absorption through a 360 \textmu m thick GaAs up to 100 K. Additionally, it was confirmed that the ps-ASP shape and amplitude remain unaffected under a perpendicular-to-plane magnetic field of B = \textmu _0H = ±50 G.

These oscillations correspond to a slight phase difference between reflectivities on diodes 1 and 2.

The characteristics of the MOKE signal following this large peak align well with the simulated trace, which relies solely on reflectivity calculations, independent of any precessional phenomena. The model demonstrates that the signal primarily results from the modulation of reflectivity by the strain pulse, which affects the σ+ and σ- probe polarizations slightly differently, and is thus detected by the optical bridge. The simulated MOKE amplitude grows with the amplitude of η(z,t) used in the model, which is experimentally dependent on the pump power. This explains the monotonous increase in peak amplitude observed with increasing pump fluence. Additionally, the simulated MOKE peak amplitude varies with the value of Δn, which can be adjusted by changing the sample temperature or the applied magnetic field to modify the Zeeman splitting. This corresponds well with the saturation of the transient Kerr signal amplitude at B_sat, where the Zeeman splitting saturates. The changes in the transient TR-MOKE signal upon magnetic field reversal can also be qualitatively explained by considering the different σ± contributions of the light and heavy hole bands to absorption (and hence to κ±). When the magnetic field is reversed, the positions of the Zeeman-split light and heavy hole bands are also reversed, but the strain-induced splitting remains of the same sign, leading to a slightly asymmetrical behavior of κ+ - κ- (and thus Θ_K) with the field, which was observed experimentally.

First, the trial wavefunction must accurately satisfy the Kato cusp condition at the nucleus to ensure the stability of the walker population.

One symptom of the rapid variation of the orbitals near the nucleus is the slow convergence of the DFT total energy concerning the plane-wave cut-off in the quantum espresso calculations used to generate these orbitals. Given the high memory requirements caused by the elevated cut-offs in the DMC calculations, we determined that the orbitals were sufficiently converged when they produced stable walker populations. For our final all-electron DMC calculations, we employed orbitals generated using the LDA functional, with a plane-wave cut-off of 68,000 eV.
