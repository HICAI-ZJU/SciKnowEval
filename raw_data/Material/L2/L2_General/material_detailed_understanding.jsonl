Previous predictions suggested that the transition of the band structure of a ZGNR towards half-metallicity could be induced by factors such as external electric fields, boron and nitrogen doping, and asymmetric terminating groups on the ribbon's edges. However, in this scenario, none of these factors are present. Instead, the effect arises from the asymmetric coupling of the ribbon edges to the substrate, breaking the inversion symmetry between the ribbon edges. While the highest occupied Kohn-Sham orbitals are mainly localized at the ribbon, some density is observed around the uppermost oxygen atoms near the ribbon edge. This asymmetry in the oxygen atoms leads to the broken spin and charge symmetries seen in the band structures. As some charge density from the spin-polarized states has migrated to the substrate, the ribbon becomes slightly doped. Calculations using the Hubbard model also predict that doping leads to similar band structures.

The charge differences of aluminium and nickel at the interface reveal that charge accumulates in the interval region between atoms and is depleted in the inner atomic shells. The charge depletion region for aluminium atoms is larger than that of iron and copper atoms. This is because the 3s3p electrons of aluminium are more delocalised compared to the 3s3d electrons of iron and copper. The 3p electrons of aluminium fill into the degenerate states of p\textsubscript{x}, p\textsubscript{y}, and p\textsubscript{z}, resulting in a higher symmetry pattern in the charge depletion region. Conversely, the charge depletion region for the nickel atom closely resembles that of iron and copper atoms, as the valence states of nickel also include 3s3d electrons. Since delocalised electrons are more influenced by surrounding atoms, the segregation energy of aluminium is greater than that of nickel and more sensitive to the composition of the precipitated phase.\n Question: Which statement accurately reflects the behavior of electron delocalization in metals with respect to their charge depletion regions and resulting segregation energies?", "choices": {"text": ["The 3s3p electrons of aluminium contribute to a more localized charge region, leading to lower segregation energy than nickel.", "Copper and iron atoms exhibit a higher segregation energy compared to aluminium because their 3s3d electrons are more delocalized.", "Nickel atoms have a larger charge depletion region compared to aluminium due to the similarity in their valence states to iron and copper.", "Aluminium's higher symmetry pattern in the charge depletion region results from the delocalization of its 3s3p electrons into degenerate states, causing greater segregation energy sensitivity."], "label": ["A", "B", "C", "D"]}, "answerKey": "C", "type": "mcq-4-choices", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_detailed_understanding", "source": "Material literatures"}}

Charge differences of aluminium and nickel at the fracture-free surface are presented in the right-hand column of Fig. 3. For the free surface, the orbital p\textsubscript{z} of the aluminium state hybridises with the d\textsubscript{z\textsuperscript{2}} of iron, lowering its energy due to the broken geometrical symmetry. The single p-electron of aluminium occupies the p\textsubscript{z} orbital, leaving p\textsubscript{xy} unoccupied. This leads to stronger vertical bonding (Fe\textsubscript{2}-Al) and weaker lateral chemical bonding (Fe\textsubscript{1}-Al and Fe\textsubscript{3}-Al) on the free surface compared to that of the interface. The weakening effect of aluminium on lateral bonding results in a lower segregation energy at the free surface than at the interface by 0.93 eV.

Specifically, the \\\\( \\triangle E_{I}^{Al} - \\triangle E_{F}^{Al} \\\\) values are positive for precipitated phases containing 50 to 65 atomic percent copper and negative for phases with 65 to 100 atomic percent copper.

Dislocation pinning strengthens the ferritic matrix, while misfit growth improves ductility. The influence of misfits produced by copper precipitates on the ductile-brittle transition is considerable. The interfacial cohesive property and the amount of precipitates present significantly contribute to this transformation. The ductile-brittle transition depends on the competition between fracture stress and flow stress. Flow stress increases as temperature decreases. When flow stress exceeds fracture stress at lower temperatures, the ferritic matrix becomes brittle. Conversely, when flow stress is lower than fracture stress at higher temperatures, the matrix is ductile. Therefore, the ductile-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) can be influenced by fracture stress, which is determined by the interfacial cohesion of the precipitates. It can be predicted that the segregation of aluminum can lower the DBTT by enhancing the fracture stress of copper precipitates, whereas the segregation of nickel can increase the DBTT by reducing the fracture stress of copper precipitates.\n Question: Which factor most significantly affects the ductile-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) in ferritic steels with BCC copper-rich precipitates?", "choices": {"text": ["The electrical resistivity of the ferritic matrix.", "The magnetic properties of the precipitates.", "The thermal conductivity of the ferritic matrix.", "The interfacial cohesion of the copper precipitates."], "label": ["A", "B", "C", "D"]}, "answerKey": "D", "type": "mcq-4-choices", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_detailed_understanding", "source": "Material literatures"}}

Moreover, the effect clarifies that the influence of copper on DBTT decrease is progressive when nickel content decreases and that the nickel content's influence on DBTT vanishes in model alloys with copper contents below 0.08 atomic percent (0.1 weight percent) after neutron irradiation at a neutron fluence of 72×10^18 m^-2.\n Question: What primary factor explains the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) shift in low-carbon, copper-precipitation-strengthened steels exposed to neutron irradiation?", "choices": {"text": ["Nickel-induced interfacial embrittlement of copper-rich precipitates.", "Reduction in neutron fluence levels.", "Increase in carbon content.", "Copper-induced interfacial embrittlement of nickel-rich precipitates."], "label": ["A", "B", "C", "D"]}, "answerKey": "A", "type": "mcq-4-choices", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_detailed_understanding", "source": "Material literatures"}}

In contrast, nickel-induced embrittlement is mainly attributed to the 3d electrons of nickel, which result in enhanced Fe-Ni bonding at the fracture surface relative to the interface. Additionally, we utilized the nickel-induced embrittlement at the interfaces of copper precipitates in ferritic matrices to explain the experimental observation: the ductile-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) of low-carbon, copper-precipitation-strengthened steels and reactor pressure vessel (RPV) steels increases with higher nickel and copper content.

Despite the ferromagnetic interaction among the carriers, their effective mass is found to be 1 to 2 orders of magnitude larger than that of typical doped semiconductors. This substantial mass renormalization can be attributed to the formation of polarons on the Ti-dimer, where a spin-singlet state is originally formed.

Ti\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{3} has an α-corundum structure, where the nearest neighbor Ti ions form pairs along the c-axis. Consequently, the two S=1/2 spins on the Ti-Ti dimer form a singlet state in the ground state, which is regarded as a valence bond solid (VBS). Therefore, the parent compound Ti\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{3} is insulating. When Ti is substituted with V, an insulator-metal transition occurs due to changes in band filling (hole doping). The carriers have been confirmed to be holes, indicated by the Hall coefficient's sign. In V-doped dimers, the singlet pairs break, and local moments of S=1/2 at the Ti sites and S=3/2 at the V sites emerge, which are antiferromagnetically coupled to behave as an S=1 local moment. The Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction, mediated by itinerant holes, influences these local moments, leading to the canonical spin-glass phase in the metallic region of (Ti\textsubscript{1-x}V\textsubscript{x})\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{3}. In this study, we find that the doped VBS (Ti\textsubscript{1-x}V\textsubscript{x})\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{3} exhibits significant negative magnetoresistance and a heavy-mass electron state likely due to polaronic coupling to the dimeric distortion. The ferromagnetic exchange interaction among localized spins is facilitated by conduction holes with low carrier density and heavy mass.

The ac magnetic susceptibility shows clear frequency dependence, and we obtain the spin-glass transition temperature Tg=2.9 K in the low-frequency limit by applying the dynamical scaling relation τ/τ0=((Tf-Tg)/Tg)^{-zν} in the frequency region of 11-9999 Hz. Here, τ, τ0, Tf, and zν denote the observation time (inverse of the ac frequency), the spin flipping time, the peak temperature measured at each frequency, and the product of critical exponents, respectively. On the other hand, the inverse susceptibility curve at high temperature is well-fitted by the Curie-Weiss law, χ=C/(T-θw)+χ0, where C, θw, and χ0 are the Curie constant, the Weiss temperature, and the T-independent constant term including Pauli and Van Vleck paramagnetic terms, respectively. Based on these analyses, we show in Fig. 1(c) the doping variation of the magnetic properties in the metallic phase of (Ti1-xVx)2O3. The canonical spin glass phase induced by V-doping appears over a wide doping region up to x∼0.4. Especially below x∼0.25, the sign of θw is positive reflecting the dominant ferromagnetic interaction between the local moments. The spin flipping time τ0 is ∼10^{-12} s, indicating that an atomic-scale spin glass state is realized in this system. According to the Monte Carlo calculation results, the change of zν can be interpreted as a crossover from anisotropic Ising-like (zν∼10.5) to Heisenberg-like (zν∼5.5) behavior with increasing V-doping level. The effective magnetic moment gSeff (≈1.4μB) also defined by the Curie-Weiss fit indicates that the spins of the Ti3+ (S=1/2) and V2+ (S=3/2) ions on the dimer couple antiferromagnetically to form S=1 localized spin up to high temperature. The small discrepancy between the expected effective moment (gSeff≈2μB) and the observed value may be caused by the valence fluctuation between V2+ and V3+ concomitant with the valence change (electron itinerancy) at the Ti site on the dimer.\n Question: What is the significance of the spin-glass transition temperature (Tg) and how is it determined in the context of magnetic susceptibility measurements?", "choices": {"text": ["Tg signifies the temperature at which a spin-glass state forms, and it is determined by applying the dynamical scaling relation to frequency-dependent ac magnetic susceptibility data.", "Tg is the temperature below which antiferromagnetic order forms, obtained through the Monte Carlo simulation results.", "Tg represents the temperature at which the system becomes purely paramagnetic, calculated from the Pauli paramagnetic term.", "Tg indicates the temperature above which ferromagnetic interactions dominate, determined by the peak of the inverse susceptibility curve."], "label": ["A", "B", "C", "D"]}, "answerKey": "A", "type": "mcq-4-choices", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_detailed_understanding", "source": "Material literatures"}}

In this system, the itinerant holes mediate the RKKY interaction between the localized magnetic moments and become highly spin-polarized at high magnetic fields by coupling with the local spins. This is also indicated by the large negative magnetoresistance. Although the carriers are readily ferromagnetically polarized in high magnetic fields such as 14 T, their effective mass is 1 or 2 orders of magnitude larger than that of conventional doped semiconductors. One potential mechanism for such mass enhancement is the polaron effect, which reflects the strong electron-phonon interaction on the dimer sites. The doping dependence of the effective mass indicates that the softening of the dimerization is essential for the enhanced interaction leading to strong mass renormalization. Conversely, the heavy holes at low density make the highly spin-polarized state more stable at high magnetic fields. Thus, the present result suggests a new route to the magnetic semiconductor based on the VBS.\n Question: What mechanism is proposed to explain the significant increase in the effective mass of carriers in certain doped semiconductor systems?", "choices": {"text": ["The presence of superconductivity at low temperatures.", "The occurrence of quantum tunneling effects in the conduction band.", "The influence of lattice distortion near impurity sites.", "The polaron effect due to strong electron-phonon interactions."], "label": ["A", "B", "C", "D"]}, "answerKey": "A", "type": "mcq-4-choices", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_detailed_understanding", "source": "Material literatures"}}

This rapidly evolving and multidisciplinary field has seen key research directions such as negative index materials, hyperlensing, cloaks and transformation optics, and chiral metamaterials. Most known metamaterials to date are constructed from metallic structures embedded in a dielectric background. However, metals experience substantial losses at higher frequencies, such as infrared or optical frequencies, which means that successful metamaterial applications in the microwave range do not easily transfer to higher photonic frequencies. The pursuit of optical frequency applications is hampered by the intrinsic loss associated with metallic compositions. To mitigate this, in 2007, Boardman and colleagues proposed incorporating active (gain) media into metamaterials to counteract the losses. Although the concept appeared straightforward, the coupling mechanisms between gain media and metamaterials proved complex, requiring thorough understanding to achieve the desired effects. Over the past two years, various groups have contributed to the theoretical framework of metamaterials with gain. For instance, Fang et al. developed a self-consistent method to describe the interaction between a four-level atomic system and a metamaterial composed of square split ring resonators.

The potential to control the effective parameters of a metamaterial by exploiting nonlinearities was first proposed by earlier researchers. In one study, a nonlinear response was achieved by incorporating a dielectric with intrinsic nonlinearity into the metamaterial structure. It was found that the nonlinear effect of the composed system can exceed the intrinsic nonlinearity of the dielectric. This behavior can be explained by a strong enhancement of the local fields near the metallic structures, which causes a strong coupling between the nonlinear dielectric and the metamaterial. Consequently, the nonlinear response of the combined system can greatly surpass the intrinsic nonlinearity of the dielectric. Nonlinear metamaterials were successfully demonstrated in the microwave regime by introducing varactor diodes as nonlinear elements in a metamaterial made of split ring resonators. It was observed that the magnetic resonance could be dynamically tuned by varying the power of the incident microwaves due to the nonlinear response of the metamaterial.

For an external electric field strength of 10 V/m, significant temporal oscillations in the level population difference and the corresponding output power are observed. This phenomenon, known in laser physics as spiking, describes the pronounced oscillation peaks within the cavity of a continuous wave laser and the emission of strong laser pulses with high electric field amplitudes during the initial turn-on phase. Spiking results from the development of a substantial population inversion that greatly exceeds the laser threshold during external pumping. At the beginning of the pump process, the lack of significant stimulated emission allows the laser gain to rise well above the threshold gain. Once lasing commences, the population inversion is swiftly converted into the stimulated emission of powerful laser radiation, depleting the gain and reducing the population inversion below the laser threshold. This initial spike in population inversion corresponds to the first intense pulse from the laser. Continuous laser pumping facilitates a periodic revival of population inversion and high laser gain, producing a train of laser pulses with heightened electric field amplitude. However, due to damping in the gain medium and various loss mechanisms within the laser cavity, the electric field amplitude of successive pulses diminishes, eventually leading to a steady state where the population inversion matches the threshold inversion and the laser emits a continuous wave at constant output power.

The ordered phase is particularly interesting due to its long-range order combined with very soft mechanical properties, making thermal fluctuations very important. In the colloidal systems considered here, the shear modulus is only a few pascals (Pa), whereas crystalline solids typically have moduli in the gigapascal (GPa) range. Comparison of the properties of colloidal systems with harder molecular solids is a matter of ongoing research. Earlier studies have largely focused on the phonon dispersion behavior measured by means of video microscopy or light scattering. However, to our knowledge, no experiment has directly verified the Debye scaling in the measured density of states of the vibrational modes. Even for molecular crystals, this has proven rather hard to measure directly; mostly neutron scattering experiments have provided some, but not much, data that agree with the expected \\\\(\backslash omega^{2}\\\\) behavior. Perhaps for this reason, the temperature dependence of the specific heat is usually taken as the hallmark for the Debye behavior of normal crystalline solids. The question we ask in this paper is how the spectrum measured in a colloidal crystal compares with the predicted Debye behavior, \\\\(\backslash D(\backslash omega)\backslash sim\backslash omega^{d-1}\\\\). To study the energy spectrum, we calculate the normal modes of a hard sphere colloidal crystal from the correlations in particle displacements. The colloidal particles used are small enough so that they perform small 'vibrations' in response to the thermal excitations of the surroundings. We use confocal microscopy to observe and record these particle motions in a two-dimensional field of view. The eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix and normal modes are then obtained from the spatial correlations of the measured displacements. The present experimental results are compared and complemented with a simplified continuum theory as well as a Monte Carlo simulation of hard sphere crystals. The main conclusion is that the spectrum of a slice of a three-dimensional system has an anomalous density of states which varies as \\\\(\backslash D(\backslash omega)\backslash sim\backslash omega^{3}\\\\), which contrasts the assumption that a two-dimensional cut should exhibit the expected three-dimensional Debye behavior.

Furthermore, the thermal relaxation, which refers to the geometric reorganization, must be fast compared to the transfer so that the system can be assumed to be in thermal equilibrium during the transfer.

In fact, this is true only for high charge carrier densities, low temperatures, and high electric fields, which are beyond the scope of the present work.

In this scenario, neither the mobility (\n$\n{\n}\n$) nor the diffusion coefficient (\n$\n{\n}\n$) depends on the temperature. For low fields, the transport coefficients are independent of the field, but for higher fields, nonlinear effects become significant, and the ratio of the diffusion coefficient to mobility (\n$D/\n{\n}\n$) increases with the field.

This difference results in a 'trapping' of the charge carrier between the monomers coupled by V1. After jumping from one monomer to the next along V1, the charge carrier is more likely to jump back to the first monomer than to continue along V2. To illustrate this trapping, a simulated charge trajectory along the a axis, created by Monte Carlo methods, shows that the charge carrier frequently oscillates between two sites, which reduces the charge mobility along the stacks.

The increase of \nRA} in this small \nd} region is due to the surface depletion in GaMnAs caused by the Fermi level (\nE_{\rm F}}) pinning at the surface and the thin band bending at the interface between GaMnAs and AlAs. The results depicted in Figures 1(a) and (b) demonstrate that the \nRA} change is small across a broad range of \nd} at both bias voltages of -10 mV and -100 mV when \nd >3} nm.

Therefore, the dependency of the resonant peak bias voltage on the parameter d closely follows the RA-d curve. This similarity is evident when comparing calculated results with experimentally obtained RA values. In our resonant tunneling experiments, however, we observe that the shifts in resonant peaks with increasing d vary significantly depending on the resonant levels. For instance, in Sample A, RA changes from 0.0549 to 0.0389 Ω·cm², amounting to a 29% change when d is adjusted from 5.0 to 17.4 nm at a voltage of -100 mV. Additionally, shifts in resonant peaks with increasing d from 5 to 17.4 nm are recorded as 12% (-130 to -115 mV), 28% (-180 to -130 mV), and 41% (-252 to -148 mV) for HH1, LH1 (HH2), and HH3, respectively. The significant differences in shifts, such as 12% for HH1 and 41% for HH3 compared to the approximate 30% change in RA, indicate that our experimental results contradict the initially proposed scenario.\n Question: In the context of resonant tunneling experiments, how does the resonant peak bias voltage dependency on parameter d differ among various resonant levels, and what does this imply about the experimental observations compared to the predicted RA-d relationship?", "choices": {"text": ["The shifts in resonant peaks show significant variations among different resonant levels, indicating that the experimental results deviate from the predicted RA-d relationship.", "The resonant peaks shift uniformly across all resonant levels, demonstrating a consistent relationship with the predicted RA-d curve.", "The resonant peak bias voltage dependency follows the RA-d relationship precisely, confirming the initial hypothesis.", "The experimental observations show that RA remains constant, negating any dependency on parameter d."], "label": ["A", "B", "C", "D"]}, "answerKey": "A", "type": "mcq-4-choices", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_detailed_understanding", "source": "Material literatures"}}

This discrepancy arises because the shift of the first level (HH1) with an increase in the parameter d (12%) is relatively smaller than the shift of the second level (LH1 and HH2), which experiences a change of 28%. This shift is similar to the change in the parameter RA (29%) with the same increase in d. Additionally, as the higher energy levels exhibit more significant movement with increasing d compared to RA, the fitting accuracy decreases for these levels, as illustrated in another referenced figure. This inherent challenge in fitting our experimental results suggests that the origin of the observed d^2I/dV^2 oscillation in our study does not stem from the two-dimensional interfacial subbands within the GaAs:Be layer.\n Question: In experimental studies involving energy levels shifts in semiconductor materials, what could be a key reason for less accurate fitting to lower energy levels compared to higher ones?", "choices": {"text": ["The lower energy levels exhibit a smaller change in shift when a parameter is increased.", "The parameter changes are uniformly influencing all energy levels, leading to similar fitting accuracy.", "The fitting process inherently favors lower energy levels due to simpler calculations.", "The higher energy levels are less influenced by different parameters during an experiment."], "label": ["A", "B", "C", "D"]}, "answerKey": "A", "type": "mcq-4-choices", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_detailed_understanding", "source": "Material literatures"}}

Our experimental results clearly show this behavior of quantization. For instance, in figures in the referenced literature, the light-hole (LH1) and heavy-hole (HH2) levels appear to branch from the heavy-hole (HH1) level at specific thicknesses around 15.7 nm and 14.6 nm, respectively. Moreover, it is evident that other resonant peaks tend to merge with the HH1 level when the thickness exceeds 20 nm. This validates the conclusion that these peaks are formed by the quantization of the VB in GaMnAs. Alternative scenarios proposed in other studies fail to explain this characteristic behavior of the resonant peaks observed in our research, as the band profile of the interface between AlAs and GaAs:Be does not undergo significant modification.\n Question: What is the primary conclusion derived from the resonant tunneling spectroscopy regarding the valence band (VB) behavior in GaMnAs as the thickness decreases?", "choices": {"text": ["The valence band (VB) levels merge with conduction band levels due to temperature variations.", "The valence band (VB) remains constant and does not demonstrate any subband formation as the thickness decreases.", "The valence band (VB) branches into subband levels due to quantization as the thickness decreases.", "The valence band (VB) directly merges with the interface states of AlAs and GaAs:Be at all thickness levels."], "label": ["A", "B", "C", "D"]}, "answerKey": "C", "type": "mcq-4-choices", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_detailed_understanding", "source": "Material literatures"}}

We observe that the interfacial subbands at GaAs:Be never merge with increasing \textit{d}. Another complication with the scenario outlined in Reference 1 is its inability to explain our experimental results, specifically the observed weakening of the resonant peaks with increasing \textit{d} as depicted in Figure 3(a, b) of Reference 3. This weakening is a typical characteristic of the resonant tunneling effect when the quantum well thickness is increased. If resonant levels formed at the AlAs/GaAs:Be interface appeared in the I-V characteristics, we would not observe such an intensity weakening, since the band profile of this interface remains largely unchanged when \textit{d} exceeds 3 nm.

No clear signals related to the interfacial states at AlAs/GaAs:Be or a thin GaAs spacer are observed in similar studies of p-type GaAs-based resonant tunneling structures.

Therefore, it is likely associated with impurity states within the bandgap. The second derivative of current with respect to voltage (\textit{d²I/dV²}) change in region (c) corresponds to the valence band (VB) edge of GaMnAs. This VB edge position is comparable to that of Sample A (around -120 mV), suggesting similar bias dependence of the band deformation in both Sample R and Sample A. Region (d) represents the VB region in GaMnAs. Previous studies on tunneling diodes with GaMnAs thickness less than 20 nm showed oscillations due to VB quantization in region (d). However, these oscillations are absent in Sample R, which has a GaMnAs thickness of 30 nm, indicating weak VB quantization. Additionally, two-dimensional interfacial states at AlAs/GaAs:Be would appear in region (d) irrespective of GaMnAs thickness due to the triangular VB profile of GaAs:Be formed in this region.

Isothermal magnetic hysteresis loops, M(H), were studied at various temperatures. For the La₀.₆Bi₀.₄Mn₀.₆Ni₀.₄O₂.₉₄ sample, a very small hysteresis loop was observed at 10 K, with a remanent magnetization (Mr) value of approximately 0.31 μB/f.u. and a coercive field (Hc) of about 0.0085 T. These values are nearly identical to those of the parent La₀.₆Bi₀.₄MnO₃.₁ phase. At low temperatures, the relatively smaller Hc indicates a soft FM-type behavior, and above the Curie temperature (Tc), the M(H) behavior is linear, corresponding to a paramagnetic (PM) state. In contrast, the hysteresis loops for La₀.₆Bi₀.₄Mn₀.₆Fe₀.₄O₃.₁ are relatively larger, with a higher coercive field of 0.25 T at 10 K, and this value gradually decreases with increasing temperature. Additionally, S-shaped hysteresis curves were noticed for this compound below Tc, resembling a glassy FM system. The highest magnetic moment values are around 0.7 μB/f.u. for La₀.₆Bi₀.₄Mn₀.₆Fe₀.₄O₃.₁ and 2.1 μB/f.u. for La₀.₆Bi₀.₄Mn₀.₆Ni₀.₄O₂.₉₄, which are much smaller than the spin-only values corresponding to the magnetic Fe(Ni)/Mn-ions. This can be explained by the coexistence of FM and antiferromagnetic (AFM) components at low temperatures. The data reveal the superposition of two types of contributions below the FM transitions. The FM component is characterized by a hysteresis loop and a finite coercive field, while the AFM component is characterized by an unsaturated magnetization that increases almost linearly with the applied field. The observed M(H) behavior in these compounds is due to the presence of different magnetic interactions. Therefore, at low temperatures, there must be a subtle balance between the FM and AFM interactions, implying that the system is electronically phase-separated into FM and AFM clusters. Consequently, there is always a competition between these interactions, potentially giving rise to a tendency for a glassy FM state in the material. The fact that the magnetic moment (2.1 μB/f.u.) is higher for La₀.₆Bi₀.₄Mn₀.₃₂Mn₀.₂₈Ni₀.₄O₂.₉₄ may be attributed to a higher FM contribution due to dominant Mn⁴⁺-O-Ni²⁺ FM interactions combined with FM Mn³⁺-O-Mn⁴⁺ interactions. In contrast, the lower magnetic moment of La₀.₆Bi₀.₄Mn₀.₄Mn₀.₂Fe₀.₄O₃.₁ (0.7 μB/f.u.) suggests that the main FM contribution is due to Mn³⁺-O-Mn⁴⁺ interactions only, with the magnetic Mn³⁺-O-Fe³⁺ interactions likely being weak. An interesting feature at low temperatures is the unsaturated behavior of the M(H) curves, even at higher fields for all samples, characteristic of glassy ferromagnets.\n Question: What might be the underlying reason for the significantly lower coercive field (Hc) observed in La₀.₆Bi₀.₄Mn₀.₆Ni₀.₄O₂.₉₄ compared to La₀.₆Bi₀.₄Mn₀.₆Fe₀.₄O₃.₁ at 10 K?", "choices": {"text": ["Needle-shaped grains leading to anisotropy differences between the samples.", "A complete absence of Mn³⁺ ions in the structure of La₀.₆Bi₀.₄Mn₀.₆Ni₀.₄O₂.₉₄.", "A higher concentration of antiferromagnetic interactions in La₀.₆Bi₀.₄Mn₀.₆Ni₀.₄O₂.₉₄.", "The dominance of Mn⁴⁺-O-Ni²⁺ interactions which contribute to a softer ferromagnetic behavior in La₀.₆Bi₀.₄Mn₀.₆Ni₀.₄O₂.₉₄."], "label": ["A", "B", "C", "D"]}, "answerKey": "D", "type": "mcq-4-choices", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_detailed_understanding", "source": "Material literatures"}}

Different models have been proposed to describe the temperature-dependent charge transport behavior for oxide systems, defined by log(ρ) ∝ T^(1/n) where n = 1, 2, or 4. These models have been compared to describe the zero-field ρ(T) behavior in our compounds. Figure 8(a) shows that the TA model, log(ρ) ∝ 1/T, accurately describes the resistivity behavior of our samples above the ferromagnetic (FM) transition temperature (T_C) with activation energies (E_a) of 77 meV and 82 meV for La₀.₆Bi₀.₄Mn₀.₆Fe₀.₄O₃.₁ and La₀.₆Bi₀.₄Mn₀.₆Ni₀.₄O₂.₉₄ respectively.

However, for the La₀.₆Bi₀.₄Mn₀.₆Fe₀.₄O₃.₁ compound, the SPH or VRH models do not fit the experimental data at high temperatures, contrasting with the TA model. Notably, for Fe/Ni-doped samples, resistivity evolution follows the VRH model only in the low-temperature region (T ≤ 220 K), as shown in the inset of Figure 8(b). This type of hopping conduction is typical of phase-separated systems (FM and AFM) where charge carriers move by hopping between localized electronic states.

Silicon is widely used in semiconductor technology and has been extensively studied for the integration of ferroelectric thin films, whereas quartz glass is transparent and suitable for optical applications. For applying an electric field to the ferroelectric films, we also deposited films on (001) Si substrates coated with conducting LaNiO\textsubscript{3} films prepared by chemical solution deposition. X-ray diffraction patterns for the BaTiO\textsubscript{3} films, shown in Figure 1, indicate that we have successfully obtained oriented films using RF magnetron sputtering. Remarkably, glass substrates also enabled orientational control of the film growth. Typically, an amorphous substrate does not provide a periodic lattice for the oriented growth of crystals through a lattice-matching mechanism. The driving force for this orientational control is not yet clear; a likely cause is the electric field applied during RF magnetron sputtering. Ferroelectric materials have spontaneous electric polarization due to dipoles formed by the displacement of charged ions within the crystal unit cell. These dipoles are subjected to the Coulomb forces of the alternating current (AC) electric field applied perpendicular to the substrate, promoting the c-axis (polarization axis) growth of ferroelectric films.\n Question: Which of the following substrates typically does not provide a periodic lattice for the oriented growth of crystals through a lattice-matching mechanism, yet enabled orientational control of the growth of BaTiO3 films in the study?", "choices": {"text": ["Silicon (Si)", "LaNiO3-coated silicon", "Chemical solution deposition substrates", "Quartz glass"], "label": ["A", "B", "C", "D"]}, "answerKey": "D", "type": "mcq-4-choices", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_detailed_understanding", "source": "Material literatures"}}

This elongation, as shown in Fig. 1a, results in a notable shift of the 001-reflections compared to bulk single crystals. The c-axis lattice constants calculated from the 002-reflection and the a-axis lattice constants from in-plane diffraction measurements are summarized in Fig. 1. Additionally, a slight increase in the a-axis lattice is observed in the BaTiO3 films, which along with the c-axis elongation, leads to an expansion of the unit cell. Under the described conditions, the unit cell volume of the film shows an expansion of approximately 5% over bulk crystals. We also observed a significant enhancement in the tetragonality (c/a - 1) of the BaTiO3 films, with values about four times that of bulk single crystals. These findings strongly support theoretical predictions that large tetragonal strain can be induced in ferroelectric PbTiO3 through negative hydrostatic pressure, with similar effects expected for BaTiO3, as reported in first-principle investigations by Tinte et al. Although applying negative pressure is generally considered experimentally infeasible, our research suggests that a negative pressure state can be achieved using an energetic plasma process such as RF magnetron sputtering. We observed that RF power effectively tunes the lattice; reducing power decreases the c-axis elongation. This effect was also observed when controlling the chamber pressure. Additionally, adjusting the distance between the target and substrate can tune the energy of the bombardment particle and subsequently modify the film states.\n Question: Which aspect of the BaTiO3 films' lattice structure phenomenon, supported by theoretical predictions, explains why it deviates from the bulk single crystals' properties?", "choices": {"text": ["The reduction in the a-axis lattice constant causing a contraction of the unit cell.", "The application of positive hydrostatic pressure inducing larger unit cell volume in the films.", "The significant enhancement in tetragonality (c/a - 1) due to c-axis elongation and slight a-axis increase.", "The decrease in c-axis lattice constant leading to decreased unit cell volume and tetragonality."], "label": ["A", "B", "C", "D"]}, "answerKey": "C", "type": "mcq-4-choices", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_detailed_understanding", "source": "Material literatures"}}

This phenomenon has been observed through chemical substitution and in strained epitaxial thin films. To detect this structural transition in our thin films experiencing a negative pressure state, we conducted temperature-dependent x-ray diffraction measurements on the out-of-plane lattices, a method commonly used to determine the transition temperature (_T_\n{c}) of ferroelectric thin films. We tracked the changes in the x-ray diffraction patterns over a temperature range of 300-1260 K with 20 K increments during heating. The representative results, shown in Fig. 2, focus on BaTiO\n{3}/Si films, where the _004_-reflection of Si serves as a reference for structural evolution detection. Similarly notable results were observed in other films as well. The data from Fig. 2 reveal a significant change in the _002_-reflection of BaTiO\n{3} films around 980 K, contrasting with the steady shift of the Si _004_-reflection due to minor thermal expansion. This abrupt change in lattice reflections signifies a structural transformation at _T_\n{c} ≈ 980 K in BaTiO\n{3} films. The out-of-plane lattice constant derived from this reflection is compared in Fig. 2 with those of bulk single crystals and the Si substrate. For BaTiO\n{3} bulk, the paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition occurs at _T_\n{c} = 398 K, above which the lattice adopts a cubic structure and shows only gradual thermal expansion. At 1200 K, the film's out-of-plane lattice constant (4.065 Å) closely matches the bulk value (4.048 Å), indicating that the expanded BaTiO\n{3} films undergo a structural transition to the normal cubic state of bulk crystals at _T_\n{c} ≈ 980 K. Importantly, this structural change is irreversible. Post-transformation, the films display both _200_ and _002_ reflections, corresponding closely to bulk crystal positions when cooled to room temperature, suggesting a reversion to the normal state of BaTiO\n{3}.\n Question: Which experimental method was employed to detect the paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition in strained epitaxial thin films, and how is the detected structural change characterized?\n", "choices": {"text": ["Raman spectroscopy, characterized by shifts in vibrational modes.", "Atomic force microscopy, characterized by measuring surface roughness variations.", "Temperature-dependent x-ray diffraction measurements, characterized by observing changes in specific lattice reflections.", "Scanning electron microscopy, characterized by direct imaging of the structural domains."], "label": ["A", "B", "C", "D"]}, "answerKey": "A", "type": "mcq-4-choices", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_detailed_understanding", "source": "Material literatures"}}

The D-E hysteresis loop clearly shows the ferroelectricity of our BaTiO3 films. The films exhibited excellent electrical insulation, allowing us to apply voltage over 200 V to the 600-nm films. These capacitors with low dielectric loss enabled us to observe dielectric behaviors over a wide temperature range of 2-950 K for the first time. Our findings suggest that the tetragonal structure of the BaTiO3 films is stable even at the lowest temperatures measured. Within the temperature range of 2-600 K, the BaTiO3 films demonstrated nearly complete temperature independence of the dielectric constant, maintaining a value close to that of the c-axis single crystals. Additionally, the dielectric loss within this temperature range is low, which is significant for technological applications. With further heating, we observed a small shoulder around 700 K, strongly dependent on the measurement frequency and likely due to space charge polarization from defects or electrode interface effects. Further heating revealed an inflection point of the dielectric constant around 900 K, where it began to steadily decrease with temperature. This inflection point is approximately 80 K lower than the Tc observed in X-ray measurements and corresponds to a similar inflection in the lattice constants for T<Tc. Although we did not observe dielectric behavior for temperatures T>Tc in this study, our dielectric measurements unambiguously demonstrated a greater shift in the paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition in BaTiO3 films compared to bulk single crystals, supporting the results obtained from X-ray diffraction measurements.\n Question: What characteristic of BaTiO3 films is indicated by their ability to maintain a nearly constant dielectric constant within the temperature range of 2-600 K?", "choices": {"text": ["The films demonstrate temperature-dependent hysteresis behavior.", "The films exhibit spontaneous polarization changes with temperature.", "The films are unstable and prone to structural changes.", "The films possess a stable tetragonal structure over a wide temperature range."], "label": ["A", "B", "C", "D"]}, "answerKey": "D", "type": "mcq-4-choices", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_detailed_understanding", "source": "Material literatures"}}

We performed full, unconstrained optimisation of the structural parameters of tetragonal BaTiO\textsubscript{3} as a function of external pressure ranging from 0 to -6 GPa. At a given pressure, the set of parameters that minimised the enthalpy was determined. The Wu and Cohen GGA function allows us to estimate the structural parameters of BaTiO\textsubscript{3}. The results are summarised in Fig. 4. The potential well for atomic displacement along the tetragonal direction becomes much deeper when the negative pressure increases, indicating that negative pressure stabilises the ferroelectric tetragonal phase. We found that the effect of negative isotropic pressure on the cell shape is to stretch the unit cell along the c-axis and to slightly squeeze it in the plane. As a result, the lattice strain and the cell volume increase with negative isotropic pressure. As shown in Fig. 4c, the -5 GPa pressure expands the theoretical cell from 64.13 Å\textsuperscript{3} to 67.50 Å\textsuperscript{3}. Correspondingly, the well depth changes from 17.54 meV (approximately 203.6 K) to 59.24 meV (approximately 687.6 K). We can use this energy change to predict the shift in T\textsubscript{c}, estimated to be approximately 484 K. Experimentally, we found that the cells expand to approximately 67.6 Å\textsuperscript{3} from the bulk crystal volume of 64.34 Å\textsuperscript{3}. Correspondingly, T\textsubscript{c} shifts to a temperature approximately 580 K higher than the bulk BaTiO\textsubscript{3} crystal T\textsubscript{c} of approximately 398 K.

One notable example is epitaxial quantum posts (QPs), also referred to as columnar QDs and quantum rods, which are formed by the closely spaced growth of QD layers. These vertically coupled QDs act as a single nanostructure. Calculations of the electronic structure of QPs show that electrons are delocalized along the entire length of the nanostructure, while holes are confined to the strain-induced region at the bottom. This spatial separation of charge carriers can lead to large dipole moments when an additional longitudinal electric field is applied, resulting in highly tunable exciton radiative lifetimes ranging from a few nanoseconds to tenths of milliseconds at low temperatures. This tunability is advantageous for applications such as quantum memories and highly non-linear electro-optical devices. Furthermore, the ability to control the height of these nanostructures with nanometer precision enhances their utility in areas where the linear polarization of absorbed or emitted light is crucial. For example, in semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs), a polarization-independent optical gain is desirable. QPs could provide a combination of broadband amplification, high saturation output power, and ultrafast response, along with controllable light polarization. Recent work by Kita demonstrated that eight alternating bilayers of InAs/GaAs are sufficient to produce QPs that invert from transverse electric (TE) mode dominant emission to transverse magnetic (TM) mode dominant emission, achieving an aspect ratio of about 0.8. In the field of quantum information technology, QPs with even more precise specifications are required. Studies by Krenner and collaborators investigated QPs with a height of 40 nm and an aspect ratio of 2, while Li and colleagues reported QPs with a height of 41 nm and an aspect ratio of 4, attributed to the smaller lateral size of these nanostructures.\n Question: Which feature of epitaxially grown quantum posts (QPs) most enhances their potential for applications such as quantum memories and non-linear electro-optical devices?", "choices": {"text": ["The long exciton radiative lifetimes that can be highly tunable through applied electric fields.", "The ability to form layer-by-layer growth, resulting in uniformly distributed QDs.", "The capacity to ensure high thermal stability of the nanostructures under different conditions.", "The incorporation of alternative materials beyond traditional semiconductors for improved conductivity."], "label": ["A", "B", "C", "D"]}, "answerKey": "B", "type": "mcq-4-choices", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_detailed_understanding", "source": "Material literatures"}}

At maximum power, the asymmetric full width at half maximum reaches 58 meV. Contrary to quantum dots (QDs) with similar inhomogeneous broadening, no additional bands associated with excited states emission were observed.

Currently, increasing effort is being made to develop lead-free ferroelectric materials with high \textit{T}\textsubscript{c}\textsuperscript{FE} and enhanced physical property performances.\n Question: Which of the following materials is commonly utilized as a base for piezoelectric devices due to its high dielectric/piezoelectric responses, despite raising environmental concerns?", "choices": {"text": ["PbTiO3", "PZT", "BaTiO3", "ZnO"], "label": ["A", "B", "C", "D"]}, "answerKey": "A", "type": "mcq-4-choices", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_detailed_understanding", "source": "Material literatures"}}

Modern research further indicates that the strong hybridization between metal atoms and oxygen is crucial for the origin of ferroelectricity in these perovskite oxides. In contrast to BaTiO\textsubscript{3}, where polarization arises from B-site atomic displacement, lead-based materials typically exhibit significant A-site atomic displacement within the dodecahedral site, in addition to the B-site displacements. The strong covalency of Pb-O effectively softens the short-range repulsive interactions between atoms, favorably positioning Pb in an off-center position within the perovskite structure of lead compounds. This hybridization is critical for the high piezoelectric performance of lead-based materials and points towards finding alternative elements to replace hazardous Pb in perovskite oxides. Ag appears to be a promising candidate because theoretical studies indicate strong hybridization between Ag and oxygen in perovskite compounds. Recent structural data supports this prediction, showing that the shortest bond length of Ag-O in AgNbO\textsubscript{3} is significantly less than the sum of silver and oxygen ionic radii, suggesting strong covalent bonding in silver perovskites. Consequently, A-site driven polarization may be achievable in silver perovskites. Experimental investigations confirm that a ferroelectric state with exceptionally high polarization (52 μC/cm\textsuperscript{2} for polycrystalline samples) can be induced in AgNbO\textsubscript{3} under a high electric field. Both theoretical and experimental findings suggest that Ag shares the essential features of Pb to induce strong ferroelectric distortion in niobate perovskites, and high-quality ferroelectrics are anticipated in silver perovskites.\n Question: Which factor is primarily responsible for the high piezoelectric performance of lead-based perovskite oxides?", "choices": {"text": ["The strong covalency between Pb and O atoms, positioning Pb in an off-center position within the perovskite structure.", "The exclusive displacement of B-site atoms within the perovskite lattice.", "The primary influence of A-site atomic displacement without any significant role of B-site displacement.", "The weak hybridization between metal atoms and oxygen in the perovskite structure."], "label": ["A", "B", "C", "D"]}, "answerKey": "A", "type": "mcq-4-choices", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_detailed_understanding", "source": "Material literatures"}}

Measurements, performed at room temperature with a powder sample of x=0.10, recorded an intensity of approximately 6*10^5 counts for the strongest diffraction peak around 2θ~32.2°.

However, double hysteresis loops with extremely large polarization can be clearly seen at higher fields. Around the phase boundary, the double hysteresis loop changes into a normal ferroelectric loop, indicating that the incorporation of Li into the Ag-site effectively unlocks the strong local polarization in AgNbO\textsubscript{3}. The remanent polarization P\textsubscript{r} measured at 80 kV/cm for ALN ceramics is shown in Figure 4(c). A sharp jump in P\textsubscript{r} at the phase boundary indicates that a ferroelectric state with large polarization is established in the rhombohedral phase. All ceramic samples show P\textsubscript{r} values comparable to that of BaTiO\textsubscript{3} single crystal (26 μC/cm\textsuperscript{2}). Furthermore, the polarization in the ALN solid solution is very stable after switching, as evidenced by the ideal square shape of the loop. The large P\textsubscript{r} value and ideal bistable polarization state of ALN ceramics may be of interest for non-volatile ferroelectric memory applications.

This suggests that Ag has a strong tendency to shift to an off-centering position in AgNbO3. The weak ferroelectricity and strong antiferroelectricity observed in AgNbO3 can be attributed to the displacements of Nb and Ag, respectively. When Li is introduced into the Ag site, the perovskite cell volume decreases with increasing Li concentration due to the smaller ionic radius of Li+ (0.92 Å) compared to Ag+ (1.28 Å). This reduction in cell volume, as evidenced in Fig. 5(c), limits the space available for atomic displacements and thus impacts the material's ferroelectricity. Despite this, polarization measurements on single crystals and dielectric measurements indicate that both spontaneous polarization and ferroelectric phase transition temperature increase with Li concentration. This enhancement in ferroelectricity is likely due to the strong off-centering ability of Li in the perovskite structure. The movement of Li to an off-centering position induces a substantial local displacement of Ag in the same direction, resulting in a ferroelectric state with high polarization in ALN solid solutions. This is further supported by the Li-concentration dependent rhombohedral distortion observed. Although the lattice constant (ar) of the rhombohedral cell remains fairly constant, the rhombohedral angle (α) decreases continuously with increasing Li concentration, indicating amplified rhombohedral distortion. Consequently, a linear increase in ferroelectric phase transition temperature and spontaneous polarization (Fig. 5(d)) is observed with the decreasing rhombohedral angle (α).\n Question: In ferroelectric materials, what mechanism is responsible for the enhancement of ferroelectric properties when a smaller ion such as Li+ replaces a larger ion like Ag+ in a perovskite structure?", "choices": {"text": ["The enhancement arises primarily from an increase in the cell volume, which allows for greater atomic displacement and stronger ferroelectricity.", "The enhancement is due to the increased off-centering ability of the smaller ion, which induces substantial local displacements and amplifies rhombohedral distortion.", "The enhancement is a result of the decrease in spontaneous polarization and the stabilization of weak antiferroelectric states.", "The enhancement is due to a decrease in the overall ionic displacement within the structure, leading to a more stable ferroelectric state."], "label": ["A", "B", "C", "D"]}, "answerKey": "B", "type": "mcq-4-choices", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_detailed_understanding", "source": "Material literatures"}}

At low temperature, the VdW attraction is the predominant competitor to the Casimir force, possibly due to the involvement of multiple exchange agents. As the temperature increases, the VdW force gradually diminishes because of a corresponding reduction in polarizability. Our study also highlights that VdW coupling is the primary component of cohesion through a universal force during the initial formation stages of matter. The electronic polarizability, which plays a crucial role in traditional approaches to polarization phenomena, results in polarizabilities of the order of, for example, a lattice constant. This trend is particularly pronounced in multilevel systems, such as those with off-center defects, where the polarizability is enhanced substantially due to electron-vibrational mode coupling, achieving a multiple vibronic enhancement far surpassing the basic electronic estimate.

What is lost through mixing is regained through tunneling, illustrating a profound feature of these systems known as smearing. The smeared system is generally larger and easier to comprehend. Due to ion smearing around the central barrier site, Mathieu's function increases its effective orbital radius significantly, leading to a large quadratic increase in the active area under the off-center volume. This volume increase results in a substantial rise in the off-center ion reactivity and its dispersive coupling with nearby off-center ions.

This behavior is commonly interpreted as a transition from conductivity-like to resistivity-like behavior, reflecting the dominance of intra- and inter-band transitions respectively. These transitions are related to the increase in the broadening of electron energy bands caused by the rise in scattering events with temperature. Adding less than 1 atomic percent (at. %) of Copper (Cu) to Ni significantly reduces the conductivity-like behavior at low temperatures, while the high-temperature behavior remains largely unchanged. Increasing the Cu content further emphasizes the impurity-scattering processes responsible for the band broadening, which dominates \\\\(\\alpha\\\\).

This phenomenon has been observed in hole-doped BaFe2As2, heavy-fermion superconductors, and electron-doped cuprates.

This has led to a common belief that superconducting order is disfavored by antiferromagnetic long-range order, although superconducting pairing can be induced or enhanced by incoherent antiferromagnetic fluctuations.
