The conductivity tensor \\(\\sigma_{\\alpha\\beta}\\) is calculated in the Kubo formalism with Green functions found as the solutions of the Gorkov equations.

In this model Gorkov equations for s-electrons in the ferromagnetic layer remain linear and are solved easily. It is shown that Hall field \\(E^{H}\\) for both F/S and F/N contacts are step-functions of the coordinate perpendicular to the planes of the layers and have zero value in S(N) layer. The Andreev reflection increases the value of Hall constant \\(R_{s}\\) for F/S case.

In perovskite manganites the e\\({}_{\\rm g}\\) band gets split due to Jahn-Teller distortion into two sub-bands, e\\({}_{\\rm g}\\)\\({}^{1}\\) and e\\({}_{\\rm g}\\)\\({}^{2}\\) separated by a gap of around 0.1eV, the width of each being 1.0 eV [13]. At room temperature (above T\\({}_{\\rm C}\\)) the Fermi level will lie in the gap opened by polarons. It will be close to the top edge of the e\\({}_{\\rm g}\\)\\({}^{1}\\) band in the hole doped manganite, and close to the bottom of the e\\({}_{\\rm g}\\)\\({}^{2}\\) band in the electron doped manganite. Thus in the semiconducting regime, the difference in the Fermi level in La\\({}_{0.7}\\)Ca\\({}_{0.3}\\)MnO\\({}_{3}\\) and La\\({}_{0.7}\\)Ca\\({}_{0.3}\\)MnO\\({}_{3}\\) with respect to their respective valence and conduction band will ensure that N\\({}_{\\rm{I}}\\)(E) and N\\({}_{\\rm{2}}\\)(E) are different. (It should be noted here that in the case of semiconductors N\\({}_{\\rm{I}}\\)(E) is the density of states of the highest occupied energy state in the semiconductor from which the electron is tunneling, N\\({}_{\\rm{2}}\\)(E) being the density of states of unoccupied state on the other side at the same energy where the electron will tunnel to). The situation is similar to an \\(n\\) and \\(p\\) type semiconductor separated by barrier and is schematically shown in figure 2. At zero bias N\\({}_{\\rm{I}}\\)(E)N\\({}_{\\rm{2}}\\)(E)=0. When a forward bias voltage is applied the product N\\({}_{\\rm{I}}\\)(E)N\\({}_{\\rm{2}}\\)(E) becomes nonzero when the voltage exceeds a threshold value, V\\({}_{\\rm{th}}\\). On the other hand when a reverse bias is applied N\\({}_{\\rm{I}}\\)(E)N\\({}_{\\rm{2}}\\)(E) becomes nonzero only when the voltage exceeds (V\\({}_{\\rm{th}}\\)+\\(\\Delta\\)/e), where \\(\\Delta\\) is the bandgap of the semiconductor. As a result the I-V curve mimics the behavior of a diode. However, these features get smeared due to several reasons. Firstly, thermal effect play a significant role since the value of the bandgap is of the order of 0.1eV, which is smaller than typical semiconductors like Si or Ge. Secondly, the leakage current through the non-ideal barrier also contributes in the reverse biased mode. The expected IV curves with and without thermal smearing are shown in figure 2(b). Assuming that the bandgap does not change significantly upon doping, a crude estimate of the bandgap from the I-V characteristics at room temperature yields a value of around 0.45eV which is larger than the activation energy deduced from transport measurements[15].

It appears that over a narrow Zn composition range the character of the martensitic transition lies at the borderline between that of a first-order (discontinuous) and a second-order (continuous) phase transition. Such an effect is certainly possible if the temperature is low because the transition is primarily shear-driven.

Of particular interest are the prototypical relaxor Pb(Mg\\({}_{1/3}\\)Nb\\({}_{2/3}\\))O\\({}_{3}\\) (PMN), and the closely related system Pb(Zn\\({}_{1/3}\\)Nb\\({}_{2/3}\\))O\\({}_{3}\\) (PZN), both of which show a huge increase in piezoelectric character when doped with the normal ferroelectric perovskite PbTiO\\({}_{3}\\) (PT) [1]. Despite intense research efforts, no consensus on a fundamental understanding of the basic lattice dynamics of these relaxor systems has been established. The identification of a soft transverse optic (TO) mode at the Brillouin zone center, for example, the hallmark of every displacive ferroelectric phase transition including that which occurs in PbTiO\\({}_{3}\\) at 763 K [2], has proven elusive in both PMN and PZN.", "answer": "false", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_hypothesis_verification", "source": "Material literatures"}}

The temperature scale for this study is set by the Burns temperature \\(T_{d}\\sim 620\\) K for PMN, where randomly-oriented regions of local polarization, of order several unit cells in size, begin to condense within the otherwise non-polar crystal structure. Experimental evidence for these so-called polar nanoregions (PNR) was first obtained by Burns and Dacol in 1983 from measurements of the optic index of refraction on both PMN and PZN, as well as other disordered systems [3]. Previous neutron inelastic studies on single crystals of PZN and PZN doped with 8% PbTiO\\({}_{3}\\) (PZN-8%PT) in their respective cubic phases at 500 K have shown that the lowest-energy TO phonon modes are overdamped for reduced wave vectors \\(q\\) less than a characteristic wave vector \\(q_{wf}\\), which is of order 0.2 A\\({}^{-1}\\), but underdamped otherwise [4, 5]. It was speculated that the PNR are the underlying cause of this \\(q\\)-dependent damping because the TO modes are polar, and thus they should couple strongly to the PNR. Indeed, it is this coupling that is believed to produce the anomalous waterfall feature observed in these and other lead-oxide relaxor systems including PMN [6, 7]. If these speculations are correct, then the search for a true soft mode can only be made above \\(T_{d}\\) since the anomalous low-\\(q\\) damping makes it impossible to observe the temperature dependence of the zone center TO mode. However, the values of \\(T_{d}\\) for PZN and PZN-\\(x\\)PT compounds approach their decomposition temperatures, making such measurements difficult. PMN, by contrast, has a much lower Burns temperature compared to that of PZN, making it an ideal system in which to look for the soft mode. We have exploited this fact to study the evolution of the lowest-energy TO branch in PMN at temperatures far above and below \\(T_{d}\\), thereby providing key insight into the role played by the PNR on the soft mode dynamics in this important relaxor system.", "answer": "false", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_hypothesis_verification", "source": "Material literatures"}}

The compositional profile of this new structure has been investigated using X-ray diffraction studies, which systematically exhibit a main alloy peak arising from the average ZnSe\\({}_{1-x}\\)Te\\({}_{x}\\) lattice constant of the alloy, with only one satellite on each side of the main peak, the latter implying that the chemical composition of the alloy \\(x\\) varies sinusoidally along the growth direction [5].", "answer": "false", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_hypothesis_verification", "source": "Material literatures"}}

Such inhomogeneity can arise, e.g., from different distances of the Zn, Se, and Te sources from a given position on the substrate at any one instant. The fact that the period of the sinusoidal modulation is proportional to the period of the rotational motion of the substrate is unambiguously indicated by X-ray measurements, the separation of the superlattice satellites from the main peak indicating that the period grows with the rotation rate. It should be noted that the satellite peak is as narrow as the main alloy peak, indicating that the SMSL structures are of very good quality [1]. The band structure of the SMSL is interesting as well, different from that of \\(standard\\) superlattice with abrupt interfaces [6]. Accordingly, SMSLs are promising for the observation of new optical effects, especially those involving transitions that are forbidden by standard selection rules, and possibly for new optical devices. Even though the physical properties of the SMSL structures are of considerable interest, little has been done so far to firmly establish the process of their formation in any quantitative sense.

In the simulation, since we deal with the coarse-grain particles instead of individual adatoms, their collective behavior is very complicated. In reality, the collective motion is not contained within the cell, but mass flow occurs across the boundary between neighboring cells. Accordingly, to mimic this mass flow, we allow incoming coarse-grain particles to diffuse to the nearest neighboring cells. This does not necessarily imply that particles diffuse the distance of a coarse grain cell. It is just the most efficient way to simulate mass transfer without considering all the details of the diffusion process. This diffusion process moderates the height fluctuation that would arise from a completely random deposition process, and enables the surface to grow in a layer-by-layer growth mode. Such local diffusion process was first introduced in a model proposed by Family [8], which results in the reduction (smoothing) of the surface height fluctuations, \\(i.e.\\), the surface of the material simulated in this way exhibits the layer-by-layer growth up to some characteristic thickness, after which the height fluctuation begins to increase with time [9]. Our simulations are thus limited to a characteristic thickness, restricted by the above layer-by-layer growth requirement. Although the above model of the eventual emergence of surface roughness is universal, being independent of the diffusion length, in our simulation we restrict the diffusion length to the lattice constant of the unit cell.

As with plane wave basis sets, their accuracy can be improved easily and systematically. In fact, there exists a rigorous cutoff for the plane waves that can be represented in a given grid, without aliasing, that provides a convenient connection between the two schemes. Soft [3] and ultrasoft [4] pseudopotentials, developed in the plane wave context, can be applied equally well in grid-based methods, resulting in an accurate and efficient evaluation of the potential energy. In contrast with plane waves, the evaluation of the kinetic energy by finite differences is approximate, but it can be significantly improved by using high order representations of the Laplacian operator [5; 6; 7]. However, an important difference between finite difference schemes and basis set approaches is the lack of a Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle in the former case. With finite differences, the accuracy of the calculation can also be improved systematically by increasing the grid cutoff (i.e. the grid density). But denser grids generally result in _higher_ energies. This feature, common to all existing real-space-grid approaches to electronic structure calculations, has been discussed frequently in the literature (see for example the discussion of equation (20) in Ref.[2]). It is one of the reasons why it is difficult to develop extrapolation methods and convergence schemes based on minimizing the total energy.", "answer": "true", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_hypothesis_verification", "source": "Material literatures"}}

We propose a simple way to construct, for any order, an alternative Laplacian representation that leads to kinetic energies that are higher or equal to the true kinetic energy. The paper is organized as follows. We first briefly present a way to construct the conventional finite difference representation of a Laplacian and show that the spectrum of the resulting operator is lower than the true one. We then apply a variation of this theme to construct a representation which has a spectrum higher than the true one. We compare the convergence of the one-dimensional harmonic oscillator energy using the two representations.

For simplicity, we use the same order for the Laplacian in the kinetic and Hartree energies. The lowest curve (left pointing triangles) shows the results of the second order Laplacian that is used in HARES [7]. The total energy converges from below, implying that the major source of error comes from the kinetic energy operator. The two curves immediately above it (up-pointing triangles and rhombuses) show the total energy convergence using the conventional formulas of order 4 and 6. The energy converges from below and quickly reaches its correct value. This is partially due to a cancellation of errors between the kinetic and Hartree energies, but the convergence is not necessarily monotonic as is manifest at 16 and 18 grid points per dimension. The uppermost curve (circles) shows the results using the new Laplacian of order 4 for the kinetic energy, and the conventional Laplacian for the Hartree energy. The total energy convergence is slower, similar to the second order conventional representation, because there is no error cancellation, since both the kinetic and Hartree energies converge from above.

There exist a number of \\(O(N)\\) methods which have been developed to calculate the total energy of the systems and the electronic forces [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]. Most of these algorithms utilize, in one way or another, the fact that the density matrix of the system to be studied is short-ranged [1; 5]. As a result, calculation of local electronic properties are possible by introducing a localization volume surrounding the region of interest where the local electronic properties are to be studied. The size of the localization volume depends on the decaying nature of the density matrix and for systems with a clean band gap, e.g., semi-conductors it has been observed that the density matrix decays exponentially [1; 4; 5]. Hence it is possible to define a localization volume having a linear dimension of the order of localization length of the density matrix. Although this does not appear to be trivially true in metallic systems [7], the _locality_ in electronic structure calculation does indeed exist irrespective of the nature of the system and was first utilized by Friedel [8] who introduced the term _local density of states_. Later Heine [9] extended this idea of local electronic structure calculation of solids in real space in the context of Recursion method [9; 10] which has been further elaborated by Kohn [11] as the _principle of nearsightedness of equilibrium systems_.", "answer": "false", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_hypothesis_verification", "source": "Material literatures"}}

The motivation behind this work is the calculation of localization properties of the vibrational eigenstates of amorphous silicon. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in the study of the vibrational modes in disordered media [14; 15; 16]. These modes can be classified as either extended or localized depending on the energy of the state. In \\(d=3\\), the modes are expected to separate by sharp energy boundary, known as'mobility edge' which marks the 'localized to delocalized' transition. The corresponding analog in the electronic system is well-known after Anderson's suggestion [17] that, unlike crystalline systems where electronic states are extended over the system, sufficient disorder can localize electronic states within the allowed energy bands. For vibrational eigenstates, however, the low frequency, long wavelength modes (sound) always exist. Garber et al. [16] studied an amorphous model of 4096 silicon atoms and demonstrated that at the mobility edge the vibrational eigenstates decay exponentially and localization length diverges as a power law above the edge. Although we are not going to address these issues here, the importance of the construction of dynamical matrix from tight-binding calculations and to study the nature of the vibrational states for a large, well-relaxed sample of amorphous silicon has its own merits.", "answer": "true", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_hypothesis_verification", "source": "Material literatures"}}

This is then followed by a calculation of harmonic normal modes of vibrations by direct diagonalization of the dynamical matrix. The diagonalization of a matrix is an expensive \\(O(N^{3})\\) operation, but since the time required to construct the dynamical matrix elements using this \\(O(N)\\) approach is much larger compared to a single diagonalization for the system sizes to be considered here, we make no attempt to obtain the density of states using any \\(O(N)\\) algorithm. In addition, we also study the nature of the vibrational eigenstates for which it is necessary to compute the eigenvectors of the dynamical matrix for participation numbers calculation. For the density of states calculation only, however, one can use any one of the \\(O(N)\\) algorithms available in the literature which include Maximum Entropy approach by Drabold and Sankey [18], Recursion method of Haydock, Heine and Kelly [10] and Kernel Polynomial approximation by Silver and Roder [19; 20] etc. For our present purpose, a single diagonalization is easily affordable for the calculation of spectral quantities whereas the construction of a dynamical matrix using the exact electronic forces by direct diagonalization is extremely inefficient and time consuming which scales as \\(O(N^{4})\\) making it a formidable task to go beyond 500 atoms. This direct diagonalizationapproach is not practical and feasible for very large system size (\\(\\geq 10000\\) atoms).

The configuration is first relaxed using the tight-binding Monte Carlo calculation as outlined in the Ref. [28]. The vibrational density of states of the Monte Carlo relaxed structure is shown in the figure 4 which has been obtained by direct diagonalization of the dynamical matrix. Since the dynamical matrix construction for this 1000-atom model took approximately 27 hours, we therefore avoid to use any one of the \\(O(N)\\) algorithm mentioned in the Refs. [18; 19; 20] for the calculation of vibrational density of states (VDOS). The VDOS in figure 4 clearly shows two peaks : a low energy acoustical peak at 20 meV and a high energy optical peak at 80 meV. The ratio of the height of two peaks are of the same order as observed in the experimental data obtained by Kamitakahara et al. [29]. The optical peak is, however, at higher energy compared to the experimental value and the value obtained from empirical potential calculations. Such a high energy optical peak has been also observed in the calculation of Klein et al. [30] who studied hydrogenated amorphous silicon using tight-binding molecular dynamics. We believe that this discrepancy in the position of the high energy optical peak is associated with the repulsive part of the potential used in this calculation. The potential produces the correct electronic density of states within the accuracy of a fraction of an eV; however, for the vibrational density of states calculation an accuracy of the order of few meVs is required to produce the peaks at right positions.", "answer": "true", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_hypothesis_verification", "source": "Material literatures"}}

A simple measure of the number of sites participated in contributing the eigenstate gives the participation number \\(P_{N}(j)\\) and is defined as \\(P_{N}^{-1}=\\sum_{i}|\\phi_{j}(i)|^{4}\\).

The inelastic decay rate and energy loss of charged particles in a FEG have been calculated for many years in the first-Born approximation or, equivalently, within linear response theory. It is well known that these first-order calculations predict an energy-loss that grows with the square of the projectile charge, \\(Z_{1}e\\), and provide a good approximation when the velocity of the projectile is much larger that the average velocity of the target electrons. However, when the velocity of the projectile decreases non-linearities become apparent. An important example is provided by the existing differences between the energy loss of protons and antiprotons [2, 3, 4], which cannot be accounted for within linear-response theory. These differences were then successfully accounted on the basis of second-order perturbative calculations that used the random-phase approximation (RPA) and treated the moving charged particle as a prescribed source of energy and momentum.

In principle, one would expect that each Mn would provide one hole, leading to a density of holes equal to that of the magnetic ions. However, while an accurate determination of the hole concentration is hindered by the anomalous Hall term, experimental data indicate that \\(p\\) is only a 15 to 30% fraction of that of magnetic ions [10, 11, 12, 13]. The mechanism responsible for the discrepancy between hole and Mn densities is not clear. As pointed out by Matsukura _et al._[11], such discrepancy might be due to compensation of Mn acceptors by deep donors such as As antisites, which are known to be present at high concentration in low-temperature grown GaAs [14]. Another possibility would be the formation of sixfold-coordinated centres with As (Mn\\({}^{6As}\\)), which would compensate Mn atoms on substitutional Ga lattice sites [15]. As a consequence, the relation between hole concentration and that of Mn has not been so far theoretically established, which would be of great interest for the design of new devices.

We also highlight in Fig. 1 the boundaries of the metal-insulator transitions (MIT's), as determined from resistivity measurements [10].

First, the model is indeed very simple, for it does not incorporate aspects such as a Kohn-Luttinger treatment of the valence states [13, 26], effects of impurity potentials, a site energy term arising from the Mn potential, a correlation energy representing hole-hole repulsion, and so forth. In addition, the model is treated within a mean-field approximation which neglects fluctuations in spin, charge, and disorder degrees of freedom. Nonetheless, one expects these limitations to be minimized, to some extent, by the fact that experimental data for \\(T_{c}(x)\\) are used as input. However, it is exactly this simplicity that allows us to obtain _a direct_ relation between hole concentration and Mn fraction, which, in turn, can be promptly used as a rough guide to experiments. Clearly, the present results must be viewed as a first approximation to \\(p(x)\\), since one should still be able to obtain such relation phenomenologically through improved models and approximations, though with a considerable amount of extra computational effort. Consider, for instance, the case of Monte Carlo simulations of the Kohn-Luttinger Hamiltonian for the semiconductor valence bands [27]: since the dependence of \\(T_{c}\\) on \\(J_{pd}\\) and on \\(m^{*}\\) is different from that of the mean-field prediction [Eq. (4)], the one-parameter fitting strategy adopted here is not so straightforwardly applicable; these parameters would have to be separately adjusted, demanding many additional runs. It is therefore hardly surprising that most of the improved theoretical approaches [13, 27, 28, 29] consider \\(p\\) (instead of \\(x\\)) as an independent variable and, accordingly, present plots of \\(T_{c}(p)\\), _for fixed_\\(x\\); the issue of the relation between \\(p\\) and \\(x\\) is then set aside.", "answer": "false", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_hypothesis_verification", "source": "Material literatures"}}

Within our approximation, the Fermi energy tracks the behaviour of \\(p\\), since \\(\\varepsilon_{\\rm F}\\propto p^{2/3}\\), while the exchange splitting \\(\\Delta\\propto x\\). Figure 2(a) shows the schematic impurity bands for each spin channel, in the very-low doping regime in which the gas is supposed to be unpolarized. As \\(x\\) increases, the gas can sustain polarization and still be insulating, provided the Fermi energy lies below the mobility edge, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Further increase in \\(x\\) causes \\(\\varepsilon_{\\rm F}\\) to increase and to lie within the delocalized states of the up-spin impurity band, as depicted in Fig. 2(c): The system becomes metallic. Whether or not the Fermi energy also lies within the delocalized region of down-spin impurity band is a very interesting question, which cannot be answered by our simple model; the solution of this particular issue should have bearings on the efficiency of Ga\\({}_{1-x}\\)Mn\\({}_{x}\\)As-based devices as spin filters. Once \\(\\varepsilon_{\\rm F}\\) reaches a maximum within the metallic phase, its initial decrease upon increasing \\(x\\) is compensated by an increase in \\(\\Delta\\), so that the Fermi level still lies within the delocalized states.

One may argue that a description in terms of _impurity levels_ rather than _impurity bands_ may be more adequate in the range of Mn concentrations considered here. Even so, the movement of the Fermi energy described above is still applicable with slight modifications: the metallic phase would then correspond to \\(\\varepsilon_{\\rm F}\\) reaching the top of the valence band.

However, the periodic boundary conditions do have important effects. As mentioned above, the velocity of the crack tip changes when the periodic images of the crack get sufficiently close to each other. In addition, for sufficiently thin systems (small width in the \\(x\\)-direction) and low strains (\\(v\\approx 0\\)), the energy released due to the Poisson ratio is enough to favor a crack growing in the horizontal direction, parallel to the \\(x\\)-axis (limiting how thin we can make our rectangular region).

[4, 5] The interface of interest can be either: (i) between two homopolymer melts (A+B) or (ii) between a homopolymer melt and a hard surface (A+substrate). Most polymer blends do not mix, because even a weak repulsive interaction causes the system to phase separate as the chain length increases. This phase separation reduces entanglements at the interface and the adhesive strength is then due to relatively weak van der Waals forces alone. For case (ii), the interfacial strength depends on the number of chemical bonds between monomers of the polymer and sites on the substrate. In the absence of strong chemical bonding, the adhesive strength is again dominated by weak van der Waals attractions. For both cases certain additives or compatibilizers can increase the adhesive strength of the interfaces. For case (i), the additive can be an AB diblock copolymer. The A(B) block of the copolymer can form entanglements with the A(B) melt side respectively. In case (ii), the additive is a chain of the A species with a functionalized end-group able to react with the substrate, thereby forming a strong chemical bond. The tethered chain of the A species can then become entangled with the melt. In both cases, larger numbers of polymer entanglements result in increased interfacial strength. The systems simulated in this paper consist of substrate-tethered chains in contact with a polymer melt (ie case (ii)), but the results can easily be generalized to polymer/polymer interfaces.", "answer": "false", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_hypothesis_verification", "source": "Material literatures"}}

Adhesion enhancement due to a tethered polymer layer shows a surprising non-monotonic behavior as a function of \\(N_{\\rm t}\\) and \\(\\Sigma\\) due to the phase behavior for the tethered chain layer. [6, 7, 8, 9] The increased work of adhesion \\(W^{*}\\) for an elastomeric system versus areal density of graphed chains \\(\\Sigma\\) is shown schematically in Fig. 1. \\(W^{*}\\) is defined as the extra work needed to separate two surfaces in addition tothe work exerted against dispersion forces alone. In Region I where each tethered chain is isolated from its neighbors, the work of adhesion increases as \\(\\Sigma\\) increases. However as \\(\\Sigma\\) continues to increase, the tethered chains begin to overlap and phase separate from the melt (region II). In this regime, the interpenetration of the tethered chains into the polymer melt decreases with increasing \\(\\Sigma\\), and as a result \\(W^{*}\\) decreases. At sufficiently high areal densities, the polymer melt is completely expelled from the tethered chains thereby causing the work of adhesion to fall off to the bare value due to dispersion forces only (region III). \\(W^{*}\\) has a similar dependence on \\(N_{\\rm t}\\). This non-monotonic behavior has been observed by Leger and co-workers [9, 15] in elastomeric materials.

For the systems of very long, entangled chains used in this study, it is not feasible to equilibrate the chains by brute-force MD simulation. In general, it is not known how to construct the correct configurations for end-tethered chains next to a long-chain melt. To avoid difficulties in initializing systems for the various wet brush regimes we restrict the present study to areal densities \\(\\Sigma\\) in the so-called \"mushroom regime\" [6, 7] (i.e. Region I in Fig. 1). In this regime each tethered chain interacts weakly with other tethered chains and may be constructed as a Gaussian chain. So, for a given \\(N_{\\rm t}\\) and \\(\\Sigma\\), all chains are constructed as random walks with the correct mean value of \\(R_{g}\\). The tethered chains are attached to the substrate wall in random locations. The correct value of \\(R_{g}\\) depends on \\(k_{\\theta}\\), which is known from recent bulk simulations. [26] The system size is adjusted so that the tethered chains do not bridge the box, thereby interacting with the opposite wall. A soft potential is used initially to remove overlaps prior to switching on the full LJ potential between monomers. The size of the simulation cell is adjusted until the pressure \\(P\\approx 0\\) resulting in an overall monomer density of \\(\\rho\\approx 0.85\\sigma^{-3}\\) (\\(\\rho\\approx 0.88\\sigma^{-3}\\)) for the highest (lowest) temperatures used. For all simulations, the number of beads in each of the melt chains is \\(N_{m}\\)=2500 and the number of tethered chains is \\(n_{\\rm t}\\)=30.

These results confirm the estimates of \\(\\Sigma\\) which place a system in the mushroom regime. Therefore, to increase computational speed the majority of the simulations (all the data presented in this paper) use \\(\\Sigma\\)=0.008\\(\\sigma^{-2}\\). For systems with crosslinking, the potential for the crosslinks is the same as the interactions between monomers bonded along a chain. The crosslinks are randomly distributed in the system at an average distance along each chain of approximately 70 monomers, which is comparable to \\(N_{\\rm e}\\). The crosslinks are added only to the melt chains after the chain configurations have been constructed and equilibrated.
