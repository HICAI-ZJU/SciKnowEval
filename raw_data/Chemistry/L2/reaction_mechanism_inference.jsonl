Nitrogen, being roughly the same size as carbon and only slightly more electronegative, is highly effective at donating its lone pair of electrons. Following nitrogen, oxygen (found in esters and carboxylic acids) is also a significant pi electron donor due to its electronegativity, though less so than nitrogen.

Amido substituents, although still activating and directing electrophilic substitution to the ortho and para positions, are less activating and less basic than amino groups. This reduced activity is due to the delocalization of the nitrogen's lone-pair electrons by the adjacent carbonyl group. Consequently, bromination of an N-arylamide typically yields a monobromo product. The amide can then be hydrolyzed with aqueous base to revert to the free amine. For instance, p-toluidine can be transformed through acetylation, bromination, and hydrolysis into 2-bromo-4-methylaniline, avoiding the formation of any dibrominated byproducts. Furthermore, Friedel–Crafts alkylations and acylations of N-arylamides are effective.

Initially, wood ash served as the alkali source until the early 1800s, when the LeBlanc process made sodium carbonate (NaCO) by heating sodium sulfate with limestone. The crude soap produced contains glycerol, excess alkali, and soap, but can be purified by boiling with water and adding sodium chloride (NaCl) or potassium chloride (KCl) to precipitate the pure carboxylate salts.

Conversely, an OH group in phenol donates electron density, making the ring more nucleophilic and reactive. Similarly, electron-donating groups like a methyl group can stabilize cationic intermediates formed during reactions such as nitration.

The formation of more stable enolates requires overcoming higher energy barriers, which can be facilitated by supplying more energy, typically by heating the reaction. Conversely, cooling the reaction can prevent the formation of the more stable enolate by reducing the available energy, favoring the formation of the kinetic product. This implies that warmer temperatures favor the formation of the thermodynamic product, which is more stable, while colder temperatures promote the kinetic product, which forms faster but is less stable.

This occurs due to the formation of 'ketone bodies' when acetyl, a byproduct of fatty acid oxidation, fails to enter the citric acid cycle. In such scenarios, three molecules of acetyl combine to form acetone.

For example, when water (H2O) dissociates, it forms a proton and an oxide anion (O^2-). This oxide anion, bearing a 2- charge, is relatively unstable due to the high electron affinity and nuclear charge of oxygen, which struggles to accommodate such a high negative charge on a small atom. Conversely, nitric acid dissociates to yield a proton and a nitrate ion (NO3^-). The nitrate ion is more stable because it has only a single negative charge, which is further stabilized through the presence of highly electronegative atoms such as nitrogen and additional oxygens.

Specifically, tertiary carbocations are more stable than secondary ones, secondary carbocations are more stable than primary ones, and primary carbocations are more stable than methyl cations. This stability trend can be attributed to hyperconjugation, a phenomenon where neighboring sigma (σ) bonding orbitals overlap with the carbocation's empty pi (π) orbital. This overlap allows for the delocalization of the positive charge, reducing its intensity on the central carbon atom and slightly dispersing it to surrounding atoms, thus stabilizing the carbocation.

This method effectively provides an estimation of the molecular weight (M) of the polymer.\n\nFor instance, in calculating the molecular weight of a 4-unit polyethylene glycol (PEG) oligomer, the formula used is OH + 4 x (CHCHO) + H. This calculation involves adding the molecular weights of one hydroxyl group (OH, 17 Da), four repeating units of CHCHO (44 Da each), and one hydrogen atom (H, 1 Da). Thus, the total molecular weight is calculated as 17 + (4 x 44) + 1 = 18 + 176 = 194 Daltons.\n\nFurthermore, it's noted that hydroxyl (OH) groups often display poorly in ^1H NMR spectroscopy due to complex reasons, which can complicate the analysis. To address this issue, polymers are sometimes synthesized with different end groups that are more easily detectable in the NMR spectrum, thereby facilitating a more straightforward measurement of the integration ratio.

When reduced by lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4), amides are converted into amines instead of alcohols. This transformation involves the reduction of the carbonyl group in the amide to a methylene group. The mechanism starts with the nucleophilic addition of a hydride ion to the carbonyl group of the amide, resulting in the expulsion of the oxygen atom as an aluminate anion. This step forms an iminium ion intermediate, which is further reduced by LiAlH4 to ultimately yield the amine. This reaction is applicable to both acyclic and cyclic amides, also known as lactams, making it a useful method for synthesizing cyclic amines.

This architecture imparts elasticity to the gel, enabling it to stretch and return to its original shape due to the cross-links. When the gel is cut, some guests may detach from their hosts at the cut surface but can reattach when the edges are brought back together, allowing the cross-linked structure to reform.

Importantly, the sequence in which the amino acids are bonded can vary, resulting in different dipeptides; for example, if the amino group of alanine reacts with the carboxyl group of serine, the dipeptide serylalanine is formed instead. Peptides have a structural backbone consisting of a repetitive sequence of –N–CH–CO– atoms.

The bond strength, also called bond dissociation energy, measures the energy required to separate the two bonded atoms completely; for the hydrogen molecule, this value is approximately 435 kJ/mol.

For instance, if a Grignard reagent, which is intended to add to a carbonyl group, instead encounters a hydroxy group, it will deprotonate the hydroxy group. This deprotonation neutralizes the Grignard reagent, rendering it non-nucleophilic and halting further reaction. To prevent such incidents, the hydroxy group can be temporarily protected, allowing the intended reactions to proceed without disruption from accidental acid-base interactions.

This reduction is catalyzed by the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, which requires two equivalents of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). The reaction proceeds in two stages through an aldehyde intermediate.

In this process, carbonyls, which are significant electrophiles, attract electrons from nucleophiles. This attraction results in the formation of a bond between the nucleophile and the carbonyl carbon. Concurrently, the carbon-oxygen bond within the carbonyl breaks. This breakage is understood to occur as the electrons are donated into the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) of the carbonyl, specifically into the C-O pi antibonding orbital. When this orbital is populated, the pi interaction that originally lowered the energy between the carbon and oxygen is disrupted, leading to the breaking of the pi bond.
