One suggested mechanism for such an ME effect arises from first-principles studies of the Fe/BaTiO\textsubscript{3} interface, which show that changes in bonding between atoms across the interface lead to changes in interface magnetization when the polarization of the ferroelectric BaTiO\textsubscript{3} is reversed. This ME effect due to the interface bonding mechanism is also expected to play a role for Co\textsubscript{2}MnSi/BaTiO\textsubscript{3} and Fe\textsubscript{3}O\textsubscript{4}/BaTiO\textsubscript{3} interfaces. Another proposed mechanism involves the build-up of spin-polarized free carriers near the surface or interface of a ferromagnetic metal. In this case, a net change in spin density can be observed on the ferromagnetic metal surface or interface due to the spin-dependent nature of the screening charges. In some systems, more exotic effects due to the accumulation of screening charge may also give rise to significant ME effects. For example, it was predicted that the change in screening charge at the La\textsubscript{1-x}Sr\textsubscript{x}MnO\textsubscript{3}/BaTiO\textsubscript{3} interface due to the reversal of ferroelectric polarization can induce a magnetic reconstruction near the interface, changing the magnetic order of Mn spins from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic. It was also predicted that even the magnitude of exchange splitting, which gives rise to itinerant ferromagnetism, can be modulated by electrostatic screening. This effect was demonstrated from first-principles at the SrRuO\textsubscript{3}/BaTiO\textsubscript{3} interface, where SrRuO\textsubscript{3}, a relatively weak itinerant ferromagnet, experiences a pronounced change in exchange splitting upon the reversal of the ferroelectric polarization in BaTiO\textsubscript{3}.

Besides this 1111-type layered compounds, superconductivity was subsequently discovered in other iron-based layered compounds with similar FeAs(Se) layers, such as 122 systems, 111 systems, and 11 systems. In all the FeAs-based parent compounds, there is a structural phase transition in the temperature range 100-200 K, and a stripe-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering associated with Fe ions accompanying the structural transition. Various chemical doping approaches can suppress the structural transition and AFM order, leading to high-T_c superconductivity. Meanwhile, low-T_c superconductivity has been observed in undoped FeP-based and NiAs(P)-based compounds with similar layered structures, although neither structural transition nor AFM ordering is associated with Fe(Ni) ions in these compounds. This result implies a relationship between structural transition/AFM ordering and high-T_c superconductivity. Theoretically, the origin of the AFM order is still controversial. One theory suggests that the AFM order is a spin density wave (SDW) driven by Fermi surface nesting between the electron pockets at the M point and hole pockets at the Γ point, based on band structural calculations. Another theory posits that the AFM order stems from short-range magnetic exchange coupling between local moments.

In particular, a theory based on a Heisenberg-type local moment exchange model suggests that the structural transition can be driven by a nematic Ising magnetic order due to the presence of intrinsic magnetic frustration.

An upward shift in the Fermi level, such as that introduced by Ti, makes it energetically more favorable for the vacancy to be in the negative charge state rather than the positive charge state. For instance, if the Fermi level shifts upward by 0.44 eV, the formation energy of the negatively charged vacancy (\n$V_{\rm H}^{-}\n) decreases by 0.44 eV, increasing its concentration by six orders of magnitude at 100°C.

Consequently, this results in an energy shift of the Auger peak, directly indicating the magnitude and direction of the local electric field. This relationship facilitates the detection of the electric field using the Auger electron probe.

The three peaks N\textsubscript{pp}, N\textsubscript{sp}, and N\textsubscript{ss} correspond to the convolution terms of s- and p-state DOS. One can see that the N\textsubscript{pp} height appears proportional to the Al mole fraction. This can be explained by the local electron concentration around N atoms as a function of the Al mole fraction. The calculated difference in charge density between the Al-N and Ga-N bonds is shown in the inset of Figure 1. It is evident that the Al-N bond has a stronger polarity than the Ga-N bond and, thus, a higher electron density around N occurs in the Al-N bond. This indicates that a higher composition of Al-N bonds will lead to a higher average electron density around N atoms. By using Eq.

Both samples are made from OD on Si but differ in their level of measured DC tunnel current. Three contributions are distinguished, corresponding to peaks in the dielectric loss C'' and steps and plateaus in the capacitance C'. The first peak in C'' (filled in yellow) corresponds to interfacial relaxations, and the second peak (filled in blue) corresponds to molecular relaxations. The contribution of the DC tunnel conductance is highlighted in green and follows a 1/f behavior. In all curves, an increase in both C' and C'' is observed at high frequencies due to parasitic inductance. The first peak is well fitted with the Debye model, which describes a set of identical non-interacting defects whose dynamics reduce to tunneling between minimal configurations. This can be linked to the bias-dependent 1/f noise increase due to a peaked density of defects previously reported for this device. The amplitude of this peak varies from device to device, with the interfacial relaxation contribution being relatively weak for sample A and strong for sample B. There is an increase in the C'' peak and the C'' plateau by about 30 times, related to an increase in the DC tunnel conductance GT by three orders of magnitude. Device B was selected to illustrate this point. The second peak was fitted with a Dissado-Hill expression. The imaginary part of this expression shows fractional power laws in the pre- and post-peak regions, indicating strongly constrained dynamics of relaxation due to interaction between the relaxing entities and their environment. The n and m exponents in the Dissado-Hill model have been related to structural characteristics.

This hypothesis is supported by several considerations: (i) the link between interface-trap assisted tunneling current and low-frequency noise in these molecular junctions, which involves traps energetically localized in the HOMO-LUMO gap of the alkyl monolayers; (ii) interface traps in other inorganic tunnel barriers usually respond within this frequency range. However, we did not observe a significant interfacial relaxation peak in this frequency range for a reference sample, meaning that the observed peaks are due to defects related to the organic monolayer and not at the Si/SiO\textsubscript{2} interface or buried in the SiO\textsubscript{2} layer. The specific nature and origin of these defects remain to be discovered. One possible origin could be interface defects at the molecule-substrate interface, such as dangling or distorted bonds. Covalently bonded organic monolayers are organized into domains with grain boundaries and may also have pinholes, another possible source could be surface states stemming from substrate surface atoms in regions where molecules are absent. It has been observed and calculated that these pinholes can significantly influence the overall electrical behavior of the monolayer devices. The proximity of the first contribution to a Debye response is attributed to a distribution of defects with a time constant response sharply peaked around the frequency f\textsubscript{1}, indicating that one type of defect seems to dominate the dielectric response in this frequency range.

We found that the Dissado-Hill function is appropriate to fit both C' and C''. It is characterized by three parameters: the pre and post peak exponents, m and n, respectively, and the peak position. Table 2 summarizes these parameters (at V_DC=0.2 V) and the maximum peak 2 frequency, f_2, deduced from the fits for the three devices. According to previous work, n is ascribed to reflect the order within clusters (n=1 representing a perfectly ordered cluster) and m is ascribed to characterize cluster size fluctuations (m=0 representing a completely frozen - no fluctuation - structure). The alkyl chains have two small permanent dipoles localized at both ends, but most of the molecules are strongly constrained since they are sandwiched between the substrate and the top electrode. The amplitudes of the two local permanent dipoles may be estimated by semi-empirical calculations between 0.5 and 1 D using MOPAC software. We did the calculation by considering a single molecule attached to a silicon cluster (88 Si atoms). These values are likely overestimations since screening effects from the metallic electrodes and interactions between molecules have not been considered. In the case of OTS on oxidized silicon, the dipole is slightly larger (1.5-2 D) since the Si-O bond is more polar than the Si-C bond. The presence of these permanent dipoles should be sufficient to give sizable dielectric polarization, but in our case, a thin electrode is deposited on top of the monolayer. As a result, most of the molecules are strongly constrained and can hardly react to an electric field, rendering them inactive during the polarization process. However, we assume that some molecules—or at least segments of some molecules—are more free. These may be preferentially located near structural defects in the monolayer. The local permanent dipoles of these molecules are then mobile or partially mobile and can follow the applied electric field, contributing significantly to the dipolar polarization. When they are reoriented by the applied field, they also affect the rest of the monolayer due to van der Waals interactions between molecules. The reorientation of mobile dipoles and the disturbances they induce in their surroundings are responsible for the observed dielectric susceptibility. The dielectric relaxation details arise from the interaction of active dipoles with the harmonic modes of the monolayer and their mechanical reaction to local constraints. The measured response is a system average containing elements from both the active dipoles and their mechanical interaction with the rest of the structure. For OTS SAM (sample C), m=0.1-0.2 and n=0.8-0.9 exponents are close to the flat loss limit (m=0 and n=1), typical for imperfectly crystallized materials. OTS SAMs are known to be polycrystalline with a short-range order (coherence length of 70 A from X-ray grazing angle diffraction). We estimate the small dipole at the foot of the molecule in the range 0.5-2 D using MOPAC software, depending on the OD or OTS samples, when the alkyl chain is in all-trans conformation and slightly higher if there is a gauche-defect in the chain. Such a local dipole has been suggested to explain dielectric loss measurements in alkyl chains grafted on porous glass and thick oxide.

Therefore, we expect changes in the interaction between the active dipoles and the inactive part of the SAM that should result in different exponents. These variations of m seem in agreement with Dissado and Hill's statement that the more mechanically rigid the structure of the system is, the more m approaches 0. This is corroborated by the behavior of m versus the application of a constant electric field (Fig. 7 for sample A with Al electrodes). The dipole fluctuations are reduced ('frozen') by increasing a DC field, and therefore, m should be reduced as observed in Fig. 7.

The cross-sections of these device structures, corresponding to the y-z plane, are schematically shown in Fig. 1. The x-axis represents the direction of electromagnetic wave propagation, while the y and z directions lie within the MGL structure plane and perpendicular to it, respectively. In this context, the MGL plane corresponds to z=0. The finiteness of the MGL structure thickness can be ignored. It is assumed that the MGL structure comprises K upper GLs and a highly conducting bottom GL on a SiC substrate or merely K GLs (without the bottom GL) on a Si substrate. Recently, epitaxial MGL structures with up to K=100 GLs and prolonged momentum relaxation time for electrons and holes (τ ≈ 20 ps) were fabricated using thermal decomposition from a 4H-SiC substrate. MGL structures without the bottom GL can be produced using chemical or mechanical methods and transferred substrate techniques, which involve chemically etching the substrate and the highly conducting bottom GL or mechanically peeling the upper GLs and transferring the top portion of the MGL structure onto a Si or similar transparent substrate. Given the considerable electron density and Fermi energy (εF^B ≈ 400 meV) in the bottom GL, the Drude absorption in this GL can be substantial. However, this can be mitigated by strong emission from the upper GLs if their count is sufficiently high. MGL structures without the bottom GL can demonstrate significant advantages.", "answer": "The study explores the advantages of lasers with MGL structures on SiC or Si substrates, highlighting that MGL structures without a bottom GL are beneficial due to their production flexibility and the potential to mitigate Drude absorption through strong emission from multiple upper GLs.", "type": "open-ended-qa", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_text_summary", "source": "Material literatures"}}

A basic feature of glass-forming supercooled liquids is the spectacular increase of the characteristic relaxation time (τα(T)) as T decreases towards Tg. Tg is conventionally defined by τα(Tg) ≃ 100 s. τα is often obtained from dielectric spectroscopy. Fig. 1 shows an example of linear dielectric susceptibility (χ1(ω)) measurement for glycerol (C3O3H8, Tg ≃ 190 K) at T = 211.8 K. The imaginary part Im(χ1) is maximum, and the real part Re(χ1) is approximately half its maximum plateau for ωα = 2π/τα. At present, the fast decrease of ωα with T has not received a unique microscopic physical interpretation, but a seminal concept is that of cooperative effects: When Tg is approached, molecules in larger regions (called dynamical heterogeneities, DH) should move in a correlated way to allow relaxation. Correlation lengths probing such cooperative effects have been experimentally extracted, leading to length scale estimates of 4-12 molecular diameters. However, these experiments were not able to test the expected increase of the correlation length as T decreases towards Tg, which is of fundamental interest. For spin glasses, the increase of the correlation length close to the critical temperature is associated with the divergence of χi (i ≥ 3). This suggests investigating χi(T) (i ≥ 3) close to the structural glass transition, although no divergence is expected. Up to very recently, the nonlinear susceptibility χ3(ω) had never been measured in these systems contrary to spin glasses. However, some important theoretical progress was made recently by Bouchaud and Biroli, who established that:", "answer": "The study of structural glasses reveals a significant increase in characteristic relaxation time (τα(T)) as temperature decreases towards the glass transition temperature (Tg), suggesting cooperative molecular movements and highlighting a need for further investigation into nonlinear susceptibilities (χi(T)) to understand the growing correlation length near Tg, as recently advanced by theoretical work from Bouchaud and Biroli.", "type": "open-ended-qa", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_text_summary", "source": "Material literatures"}}

One potential application of this principle is in designing a bridge dedicated to measuring nonlinear magnetic susceptibility.

The nonlinear part of this response appears in its harmonics. Measuring these harmonics is challenging for weak nonlinear responses because the electronic devices used for excitation and measurement are always nonlinear to some extent. Our experiment, designed to measure the nonlinear response of dielectric supercooled liquids, focuses on the third harmonics component of the polarization when an electric field is applied to a sample layer in a plane capacitor. This involves measuring a current, denoted as I(3ω), at a frequency three times that of the linear response, I(ω), when a voltage, Vs(ω), is applied to the capacitor. Both the lock-in amplifier and the voltage source produce a third harmonics component, complicating the measurement of the nonlinear response in straightforward experiments like the one described in section III.2. To address this issue, we employed a method based on a bridge with two capacitors of different thicknesses. This setup significantly reduces the two spurious third harmonics components of the measured signal: those from the voltage source and the lock-in amplifier. Using this 'two-sample' bridge with a low-distortion voltage source allowed us to achieve a sensitivity better than 10^-7 and perform our initial measurements of the nonlinear response of a supercooled liquid near the glass transition.", "answer": "The experiment successfully measured the nonlinear response of dielectric supercooled liquids near the glass transition by using a 'two-sample' bridge method to mitigate spurious third harmonics from the voltage source and lock-in amplifier, achieving high sensitivity.", "type": "open-ended-qa", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_text_summary", "source": "Material literatures"}}

This reveals a net shift of the resonances, apart from the broadening or narrowing, upon rotation of the moments. The net shift stems from the majority-minority-state repulsion, and can be identified with the kinetic exchange. Its maximal value, indicated by arrows in Fig. 2, is strong in Cr, but less so in Mn, probably because the Mn d-states are lower in energy and thus more localized spatially, reducing the hopping. This is one reason why Mn shows a weaker exchange coupling than Cr. Another, more important reason is that for Cr E_F bisects J(E) at a high point, in the middle of the plateau, while for Mn E_F is already at a point of strong descent of J(E), close to changing sign. Here, the double-exchange mechanism among the minority-spin states is already starting to set in, competing with the kinetic exchange.

Such a function should be (i) derived from the structure itself, rather than its properties such as energy, (ii) invariant with respect to shifts of the coordinate system, rotations, and reflections, (iii) sensitive to different orderings of the atoms, for instance, being able to distinguish between different orderings in face-centered cubic (fcc) alloys, (iv) formally related either to experiment, such as diffraction patterns, or microscopic energetics, and (v) robust against numerical errors. In addition, fingerprints of similar structures should be similar, and the difference of fingerprint functions should be a reasonable measure of structural similarity or dissimilarity. The definition involves a sum over all interatomic distances, denoted as  Rij.", "answer": "The fingerprint function uniquely characterizes structures based on interatomic distances, maintaining invariance under coordinate changes, sensitivity to atomic order, formal experimental relevance, robustness to numerical errors, and providing a basis for comparing structural similarities.", "type": "open-ended-qa", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_text_summary", "source": "Material literatures"}}

The double sum runs over all atoms (i) within the unit cell and (j) within the threshold distance (Rmax) of the i-th atom. V represents the unit cell volume, and ∂(R-Rij) is a Gaussian-smeared delta-function, which absorbs numerical errors and makes Φ(R) a smooth function. To ensure robustness against numerical errors and computational convenience, the Φ(R) function is discretized over bins of width Δ. This Φ-fingerprint is short-ranged, meaning it tends to zero at infinite R, and Φ(0) = -1. When b-parameters are set to atomic neutron scattering lengths, Φ(R) is related to the structure factor.", "answer": "The text explains that the normalization factor accounts for atomic properties and numbers in the unit cell, and describes the Φ(R) function's properties and its relationship to the structure factor when using atomic neutron scattering lengths.", "type": "open-ended-qa", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_text_summary", "source": "Material literatures"}}

To address these issues, we separate components of the fingerprint function derived from different atomic type pairs A-B. This results in the total fingerprint forming a matrix where each element is a function defined by F_AB(R)=∑_(A_i,cell) ∑_(B_j) δ(R-R_ij)/ 4πR_ij²(N_A N_B /V_cell Δ) - 1 = g_AB(R) - 1.", "answer": "The text describes how separating components of the X-ray scattering fingerprint by atomic pairs A-B improves sensitivity to atomic ordering and forms a detailed matrix representing the structure.", "type": "open-ended-qa", "domain": "Material", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "material_text_summary", "source": "Material literatures"}}
