The Dutch physicist Huygens constructed a pendulum whose period is independent of its amplitude. He did this by allowing the string of the pendulum to wrap partially around constraining rails that follow the shape of cycloid (see right figure). The x and y cartesian coordinates of the pendulum bob’s (see figure for the definition of the x, y coordinates) are then constrained to follow a trajectory that can be parametrized by an angle ϕ (do not attempt to show this)\nx = (l/4)(ϕ + sin ϕ)\ny = (l/4)(3 + cos ϕ),\nwhere l is the length of the string. The equilibrium position of the bob x = 0, y = l is given by ϕ = 0.\n(d) Use the Lagrangian in (c) to find the general solution for u as a function of time. Argue that the motion in ϕ is periodic and determine its period. How does this period compare with the period of small oscillations of the simple pendulum?", "answer": "We have\n∂L/∂˙u = m*l^2*˙u,\nd/dt (∂L/∂˙u) = m*l^2*¨u,\n∂L/∂u = −m*g*l*u.\nThus, the Euler-Lagrange equation for u is\n¨u + (g/l)*u = 0.\nThis is the equation of a harmonic oscillator and its general solution is given by\nu = u0 sin(ωt + θ0),\nwhere ω = √(g/l). The angle ϕ = 2 arcsin u is thus periodic in time with a period of T = 2π/ω = 2π√(l/g), the same as for the simple pendulum in the limit of small oscillations.", "type": "open-ended-qa", "domain": "Physics", "details": {"level": "L5", "task": "physics_problem_solving", "subtask": "Classical_Mechanics", "source": "Yale Qualifying Exam"}}

Find the five lowest energy eigenstates and eigenvalues of this system. Hint: express a two-particle eigenstate as a product of a spatial wave function and a spin wave function.", "answer": "Since there is no interaction and no spin-dependence in the Hamiltonian, the energy eigenvalues are determined solely by the spatial degree of freedom x, and the many-body states will be appropriately antisymmetrized combinations of the single-particle states. The boundary conditions for the single-particle wave function ψ(x) in an infinite square well between x = −L/2 and x = L/2 are ψ(−L/2) = ψ(L/2) = 0. The normalized single-particle eigenstates are given by ψn(x) = √(2/L) { cos(πnx/L) for n odd, sin(πnx/L) for n even }. The corresponding eigenvalues are ϵn = ℏ²π²n²/2mL². We label these single-particle eigenstates as |n⟩i, where i = 1, 2 labels the particle. The two-particle wave function can be expressed as a product of a spatial wave function and a spin wave function. The total wave function must be antisymmetric under the exchange of the two particles. Thus, when the spatial wave function is symmetric, the spin wave function must be antisymmetric and vice versa. The lowest two-particle eigenstate corresponds to both particles in the lowest spatial single-particle state n = 1 and its energy is E = 2ϵ1 = ℏ²π²/mL². The corresponding spatial wave function |1⟩1|1⟩2 is symmetric, hence the spin wave function must be antisymmetric (i.e., a singlet). The complete normalized ground-state wave function is (|1⟩1|1⟩2) 1/√2 (| ↑⟩1| ↓⟩2 −| ↓⟩1| ↑⟩2). The next lowest two-particle states will involve particles in the spatial single-particle states n = 1 and n = 2 with total energy of E = ϵ1 + ϵ2 = 5ℏ²π²/2mL².

The eigenstates of H for two distinguishable particles are specified by two non-negative integer quantum numbers j, k (one for each particle), and the total energy is the sum of the two energies E_{j,k} = ℏω(j + 1/2) + ℏω(k + 1/2) = ℏω(j + k + 1). For bosons, the total wave function must be symmetric under particle exchange, and without spin this means Ψ(x₁, x₂) = Ψ(x₂, x₁). The lowest possible total energy is for j = k = 0 which is symmetric: if φₙ(x) are the harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions, Ψ₀(x₁, x₂) = φ₀(x₁)φ₀(x₂) is clearly symmetric. The first excited state for bosons is the symmetric combination of j = 1, k = 0 and j = 0, k = 1: Ψ₁(x₁, x₂) = (φ₁(x₁)φ₀(x₂) + φ₀(x₁)φ₁(x₂))/√2, and its energy is 2ℏω.", "type": "open-ended-qa", "domain": "Physics", "details": {"level": "L5", "task": "physics_problem_solving", "subtask": "Quantum_Mechanics", "source": "Yale Qualifying Exam"}}

The coordinate operator of a harmonic oscillator can be written in terms of raising and lowering operators as x = √(ℏ/(2mω))(a + a†) where ω = √(k/m).\n(c) Assume the two particles are non-interacting spin-1/2 electrons. What are E₀ and E₁ and their degeneracies?", "answer": "For two spin-1/2 electrons, the total wave function can be written as a spatial part times a spin part and must be antisymmetric. If we add the two spins, the total allowed spin is either S = 0 or S = 1. An S = 0 state (|↑, ↓⟩ - |↓, ↑⟩)/√2 is antisymmetric in spin space while the S = 1 state is symmetric. The ground state is obtained by putting both particles in the lowest oscillator orbital (symmetric in space) and is thus an S = 0 state with energy E₀ = ℏω. This situation corresponds to part (a) where the spatial wave function is symmetric. The first excited level is obtained by putting one electron in oscillator level 0 and another electron in oscillator level 1, each one with either spin up or spin down. Its energy is E₁ = 2ℏω. Now both S = 0 and S = 1 are allowed. In particular, the S = 1, S_z = 1 state with both electron spins up is symmetric in spin space and antisymmetric in space and is therefore analogous to the spatial state in part (b). The S = 0 ground state is non-degenerate. However, the excited level has both S = 0 (one state) and S = 1 (three states S_z = -1, 0, +1) and is therefore four-fold degenerate.", "type": "open-ended-qa", "domain": "Physics", "details": {"level": "L5", "task": "physics_problem_solving", "subtask": "Quantum_Mechanics", "source": "Yale Qualifying Exam"}}
