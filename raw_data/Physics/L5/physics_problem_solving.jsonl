While the molecular mechanisms are not well understood, here we will examine a candidate mechanism for a 'molecular thermometer' that reads out temperature by unfolding near a temperature T_u.

The two-particle wave function can be expressed as a product of a spatial wave function and a spin wave function. The total wave function must be antisymmetric under the exchange of the two particles. Thus, when the spatial wave function is symmetric, the spin wave function must be antisymmetric and vice versa. The lowest two-particle eigenstate corresponds to both particles in the lowest spatial single-particle state n = 1 and its energy is E = 2\u03f51 = \u210f\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2/mL\u00b2. The corresponding spatial wave function |1\u27e91|1\u27e92 is symmetric, hence the spin wave function must be antisymmetric (i.e., a singlet). The complete normalized ground-state wave function is (|1\u27e91|1\u27e92) 1/\u221a2 (| \u2191\u27e91| \u2193\u27e92 \u2212| \u2193\u27e91| \u2191\u27e92). The next lowest two-particle states will involve particles in the spatial single-particle states n = 1 and n = 2 with total energy of E = \u03f51 + \u03f52 = 5\u210f\u00b2\u03c0\u00b2/2mL\u00b2. These could be combined into a symmetric spatial wave function, which would require an antisymmetric (i.e., singlet) spin wave function 1/\u221a2 (|1\u27e91|2\u27e92 + |2\u27e91|1\u27e92) 1/\u221a2 (| \u2191\u27e91| \u2193\u27e92 \u2212| \u2193\u27e91| \u2191\u27e92), or they could be combined into an antisymmetric spatial wave function, which would require a symmetric (i.e., triplet) spin wave function. Note that there are three symmetric spin wave functions giving three two-particle eigensates 1/\u221a2 (|1\u27e91|2\u27e92 \u2212|2\u27e91|1\u27e92) (| \u2191\u27e91| \u2191\u27e92), 1/\u221a2 (|1\u27e91|2\u27e92 \u2212|2\u27e91|1\u27e92) 1/\u221a2 (| \u2191\u27e91| \u2193\u27e92 + | \u2193\u27e91| \u2191\u27e92), 1/\u221a2 (|1\u27e91|2\u27e92 \u2212|2\u27e91|1\u27e92) (| \u2193\u27e91| \u2193\u27e92). These last four states all have the same energy E = \u03f51 + \u03f52. The next lowest energy state will have both particles in n = 2 giving an energy of 2\u03f52 > \u03f51 + \u03f52.

The antisymmetric spin wave function is an S = 0 state with eigenvalue \u22123A/4 of Hex, while the three symmetric spin wave functions are S = 1 states with degenerate eigenvalue A/4 of Hex.

Thus the j = k = 0 solution is not allowed (you can\u2019t put two fermions in the same state). The first allowed state is the antisymmetric combination of j = 1, k = 0 and j = 0, k = 1: \u03a8\u2080(x\u2081, x\u2082) = [\u03c6\u2081(x\u2081)\u03c6\u2080(x\u2082) - \u03c6\u2080(x\u2081)\u03c6\u2081(x\u2082)]/\u221a2. Thus E\u2080 = 2\u210f\u03c9.

Each particle moves in a harmonic trapping potential V(x) = (1/2)kx\u00b2 where k > 0. The coordinate operator of a harmonic oscillator can be written in terms of raising and lowering operators as x = \u221a(\u210f/(2m\u03c9))(a + a\u2020) where \u03c9 = \u221a(k/m).\n(c) Assume the two particles are non-interacting spin-1/2 electrons. What are E\u2080 and E\u2081 and their degeneracies?", "answer": "For two spin-1/2 electrons, the total wave function can be written as a spatial part times a spin part and must be antisymmetric. If we add the two spins, the total allowed spin is either S = 0 or S = 1. An S = 0 state (|\u2191, \u2193\u27e9 - |\u2193, \u2191\u27e9)/\u221a2 is antisymmetric in spin space while the S = 1 state is symmetric. The ground state is obtained by putting both particles in the lowest oscillator orbital (symmetric in space) and is thus an S = 0 state with energy E\u2080 = \u210f\u03c9. This situation corresponds to part (a) where the spatial wave function is symmetric. The first excited level is obtained by putting one electron in oscillator level 0 and another electron in oscillator level 1, each one with either spin up or spin down. Its energy is E\u2081 = 2\u210f\u03c9. Now both S = 0 and S = 1 are allowed. In particular, the S = 1, S_z = 1 state with both electron spins up is symmetric in spin space and antisymmetric in space and is therefore analogous to the spatial state in part (b). The S = 0 ground state is non-degenerate. However, the excited level has both S = 0 (one state) and S = 1 (three states S_z = -1, 0, +1) and is therefore four-fold degenerate.", "type": "open-ended-qa", "domain": "Physics", "details": {"level": "L5", "task": "physics_problem_solving", "subtask": "Quantum_Mechanics", "source": "Yale Qualifying Exam"}, "answerKey": "", "choices": {"text": [], "label": []}}
