The field energy density is given by u = (1/8π)(E² + B²), and we have to compare the time derivative of Etot = ∫udV to the result above. Since ⃗E is time-independent, we do not have to calculate its contribution to the energy density. Since B is spatially constant within the cylinder, the total magnetic energy is Etot,magnetic = (1/8π)πR²(4π/c)²σ²α²t²R² = 2π²/(c²)α²t²R⁴σ². Thus dEtot/dt = 4π²/(c²)α²tR⁴σ². This is the same as the integral of the Poynting vector calculated above. It expresses the conservation of energy (the rate at which energy is input into the system is equal to the rate of change of the total energy of the system).", "type": "open-ended-qa", "domain": "Physics", "details": {"level": "L5", "task": "physics_problem_solving", "subtask": "Electromagnetism", "source": "Yale Qualifying Exam"}}
