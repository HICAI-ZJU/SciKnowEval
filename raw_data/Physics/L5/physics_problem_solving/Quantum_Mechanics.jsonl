There are two matching conditions at x = 0: (i) The continuity of the wave function ψ(0+) = ψ(0−) ⇒ A+ sin(ka) = −A− sin(ka) (ii) The discontinuity of ψ'(x) at x = 0 is determined by integrating the Schrödinger equation in a small interval around x = 0. We find ψ'(0+) − ψ'(0−) = (2m/ℏ²) βE1a ψ(0). This leads to A+ k cos(ka) − A− k cos(ka) = A− (2m/ℏ²) βE1a sin(ka). There are two classes of solutions: I. sin(ka) = 0 and A+ = A−. Then kn = n π/2a with n even, and the corresponding energy eigenvalues are En = ℏ²π²n²/(8ma²). These eigenvalues are the same as the unperturbed problem. II. If sin(ka) ≠ 0, then from the first matching condition we have A+ = −A−. The second condition leads to cot(ka) = −(mβE1a²)/(kaℏ²). This is an implicit equation that determines the allowed discrete values of k. The energy eigenvalues are then given by E = ℏ²k²/(2m).", "type": "open-ended-qa", "domain": "Physics", "details": {"level": "L5", "task": "physics_problem_solving", "subtask": "Quantum_Mechanics", "source": "Yale Qualifying Exam"}}

This describes an infinite square well potential of width 2a centered at the origin. Let this system be perturbed by a delta function potential at the origin H' = βE1aδ(x), where E1 is the unperturbed ground-state energy, and β is a small dimensionless parameter. Find the exact energy eigenvalues in the presence of both the delta function potential and the infinite square well. Use the piecewise solution for the wave function ψ(x) = A+sin(k(x−a)) for 0 < x < a and A−sin(k(x+a)) for −a < x < 0. Impose the continuity of ψ(x) at x = 0, and determine the discontinuity of the wave function derivative ψ'(x) at x = 0 by integrating the Schrödinger equation in a small interval around the origin. Consider the even and odd parity solutions separately, and show that the energy eigenvalues of one class of solutions are not affected by the presence of the delta function potential. For the other class, find the equation that determines implicitly the exact energy eigenvalues. Check that the exact energy eigenvalues you found in (c) agree with your result in (b) to first order in β.", "answer": "(d) In class I of solutions, the energy eigenvalues are the same as the unperturbed problem, in agreement with first-order perturbation theory. For class II of solutions in the limit β → 0, we have cot(ka) = 0 or kn = n π/2a with n odd. Solving the implicit equation for k to first-order in β we find kna ≈ nπ/2 + (mβE1a²)/(nπ/2ℏ²). The corresponding energy eigenvalues are then given by En ≈ ℏ²k²n/(2m) = ℏ²/(2ma²) [(nπ/2)² + (mβE1a²)/(nπ/2ℏ²)] = ℏ²π²n²/(8ma²) + βE1, where the last equality holds to first order in β.

Find the five lowest energy eigenstates and eigenvalues of this system. Hint: express a two-particle eigenstate as a product of a spatial wave function and a spin wave function.", "answer": "Since there is no interaction and no spin-dependence in the Hamiltonian, the energy eigenvalues are determined solely by the spatial degree of freedom x, and the many-body states will be appropriately antisymmetrized combinations of the single-particle states. The boundary conditions for the single-particle wave function ψ(x) in an infinite square well between x = −L/2 and x = L/2 are ψ(−L/2) = ψ(L/2) = 0. The normalized single-particle eigenstates are given by ψn(x) = √(2/L) { cos(πnx/L) for n odd, sin(πnx/L) for n even }. The corresponding eigenvalues are ϵn = ℏ²π²n²/2mL². We label these single-particle eigenstates as |n⟩i, where i = 1, 2 labels the particle. The two-particle wave function can be expressed as a product of a spatial wave function and a spin wave function. The total wave function must be antisymmetric under the exchange of the two particles. Thus, when the spatial wave function is symmetric, the spin wave function must be antisymmetric and vice versa. The lowest two-particle eigenstate corresponds to both particles in the lowest spatial single-particle state n = 1 and its energy is E = 2ϵ1 = ℏ²π²/mL². The corresponding spatial wave function |1⟩1|1⟩2 is symmetric, hence the spin wave function must be antisymmetric (i.e., a singlet). The complete normalized ground-state wave function is (|1⟩1|1⟩2) 1/√2 (| ↑⟩1| ↓⟩2 −| ↓⟩1| ↑⟩2). The next lowest two-particle states will involve particles in the spatial single-particle states n = 1 and n = 2 with total energy of E = ϵ1 + ϵ2 = 5ℏ²π²/2mL².

Note that there are three symmetric spin wave functions giving three two-particle eigensates 1/√2 (|1⟩1|2⟩2 −|2⟩1|1⟩2) (| ↑⟩1| ↑⟩2), 1/√2 (|1⟩1|2⟩2 −|2⟩1|1⟩2) 1/√2 (| ↑⟩1| ↓⟩2 + | ↓⟩1| ↑⟩2), 1/√2 (|1⟩1|2⟩2 −|2⟩1|1⟩2) (| ↓⟩1| ↓⟩2). These last four states all have the same energy E = ϵ1 + ϵ2. The next lowest energy state will have both particles in n = 2 giving an energy of 2ϵ2 > ϵ1 + ϵ2.

Find the exact (i.e., not just in perturbation theory) five lowest energy eigenstates and eigenvalues. Assume that A is much smaller than the ground-state energy you found in part (a).", "answer": "The additional spin-dependent interaction term in the Hamiltonian will cause the energy eigenvalues to depend upon the spin state. To determine this dependence, we can rewrite the interaction as Hex = A⃗σ1 · ⃗σ2 = A (⃗S² −⃗σ²1 −⃗σ²2)/2 = A (⃗S² −3/2)/2, where ⃗S = ⃗σ1 + ⃗σ2 is the total spin of the two particles and we have used ⃗σ²1 = ⃗σ²1 = 3/4. The spin wave functions used in the solution of part (a) are eigenstates of ⃗S² with eigenvalues S(S+1) and therefore also eigenstates of the interaction term with eigenvalues A[S(S+1)−3/2]/2. The antisymmetric spin wave function is an S = 0 state with eigenvalue −3A/4 of Hex, while the three symmetric spin wave functions are S = 1 states with degenerate eigenvalue A/4 of Hex.

{"prompt": {"default": "You're an expert in Physics. Given a brief requirements description of university physics word problem, your task is to output the process and answer of the question in detail directly, do not output other characters."}, "question": "Two identical non-relativistic particles of mass m are confined to one dimension (the x axis). Each particle moves in a harmonic trapping potential V(x) = (1/2)kx² where k > 0. The coordinate operator of a harmonic oscillator can be written in terms of raising and lowering operators as x = √(ℏ/(2mω))(a + a†) where ω = √(k/m).\n(c) Assume the two particles are non-interacting spin-1/2 electrons. What are E₀ and E₁ and their degeneracies?", "answer": "For two spin-1/2 electrons, the total wave function can be written as a spatial part times a spin part and must be antisymmetric. If we add the two spins, the total allowed spin is either S = 0 or S = 1. An S = 0 state (|↑, ↓⟩ - |↓, ↑⟩)/√2 is antisymmetric in spin space while the S = 1 state is symmetric. The ground state is obtained by putting both particles in the lowest oscillator orbital (symmetric in space) and is thus an S = 0 state with energy E₀ = ℏω. This situation corresponds to part (a) where the spatial wave function is symmetric. The first excited level is obtained by putting one electron in oscillator level 0 and another electron in oscillator level 1, each one with either spin up or spin down. Its energy is E₁ = 2ℏω. Now both S = 0 and S = 1 are allowed. In particular, the S = 1, S_z = 1 state with both electron spins up is symmetric in spin space and antisymmetric in space and is therefore analogous to the spatial state in part (b). The S = 0 ground state is non-degenerate. However, the excited level has both S = 0 (one state) and S = 1 (three states S_z = -1, 0, +1) and is therefore four-fold degenerate.", "type": "open-ended-qa", "domain": "Physics", "details": {"level": "L5", "task": "physics_problem_solving", "subtask": "Quantum_Mechanics", "source": "Yale Qualifying Exam"}}
