Thus, in two dimensions the spectral energy density is u(ω, T) = ℏ/(2πc^2) ω^2/(e^(βℏω) - 1). Substituting in the integral x = βℏω, the total energy density is U/A = k^3_B T^3/(2πc^2ℏ^2) ∫_(0)^∞ dx x^2/(e^x - 1) = k^3_B/(πc^2ℏ^2) ζ(3) T^3, where we have represented the dimensionless integral using the Riemann ζ function ζ(n + 1) = 1/n! ∫_(0)^∞ dx x^n/(e^x - 1).", "type": "open-ended-qa", "domain": "Physics", "details": {"level": "L5", "task": "physics_problem_solving", "subtask": "Statistical_Mechanics", "source": "Yale Qualifying Exam"}}

Second derivation of entropy: consider the free energy F = -k_BT ln Z, in which case S = -∂F/∂T = -∂/∂T (Ak_B T/(2πc^2)) ∫_(0)^∞ dω ω ln(1 - e^(-βℏω)) = -∂/∂T (Ak^3_B T^3/(2πc^2ℏ^2)) ∫_(0)^∞ dx x ln(1 - e^(-x)) = (3Ak^3_B T^2/(2πc^2ℏ^2)) ∫_(0)^∞ dx x ln(1 - e^(-x)), where the integral in brackets is also equal to ζ(3) upon integration by parts.
