This study adopts a different approach from Kelvin’s theorem, but we also require a Newtonian fluid in an inertial frame of reference with a constant coefficient of viscosity. Assuming irrotational flow for all time, we explore what this implies for the general solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, including unsteady 3D flow.

Commonly, voxel sizes are around a millimeter. Another application of a spatially-varying precession rate is in sensitizing the signal to molecular motion, particularly diffusion. When molecules follow random (Brownian) paths, different locations they visit impart various precessional angles on them, causing their precessions to lose coherence and attenuating the sum of their emitted radio waves. This attenuation of MR signal, specifically its response to the direction of the gradient in the precession rate, can reveal or quantify molecular mobility in different directions. Differences in mobility can result from pore boundaries, impurities, cell membranes, and other factors. Therefore, the diffusion-attenuated signal encodes the influence of structures that can be significantly smaller than a voxel.", "answer": "The diffusion-attenuated MR signal can quantify molecular mobility and reveal the influence of structures smaller than a voxel by analyzing the varying precessional angles imparted by molecular diffusion.", "type": "open-ended-qa", "domain": "Physics", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "physics_text_summary", "source": "Physics Literatures"}}

If feasible, the material can be powdered for this purpose, known as powder averaging. However, in biomedical applications, this is generally impossible.

In a nutshell, the DDE technique encodes into the signal the joint probability of two Brownian displacements taking place between the two pulses of each block. For freely diffusing molecules, the two displacements are uncorrelated.
