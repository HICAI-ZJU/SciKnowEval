In this paper, we report the development of a hybrid microwave-optical time scale, which only requires the optical clock to run intermittently while relying upon the ensemble of microwave clocks to serve as the flywheel oscillator. The benefit of using a clock ensemble as the flywheel oscillator, instead of a single clock, can be understood by the Dick-effect limit. This time scale demonstrates for the first time sub-nanosecond accuracy for a few months, attaining a fractional frequency stability of 1.45×10−16 at 30 days and reaching the 10−17 decade at 50 days, with respect to UTC.

Most commonly, complex wavenumbers and frequencies are a direct outcome of including dissipation in the system, with a complex frequency representing a temporally dissipating wave whereas a complex wavenumber represents a spatially dissipating wave. However, imaginary and/or complex wavenumbers appear even in the absence of dissipation and serve the very important purpose of satisfying interface continuity conditions in scattering problems. The simplest of the non-standard eigenvalue cases is the solution of the ω(β) eigenvalue form in the presence of dissipation.

While the sp2 binding energy is well established, there is disagreement for the sp3 value in the literature. Here, we compute the binding energy values for model structures of pure and doped-diamond using density functional theory. The simulation results indicate that the large band-gap of diamond allows defects to pin the Fermi level, which results in large variations of the C(1s) core electron energies for sp3-bonded carbon, in agreement with the broad range of experimental C(1s) binding energy values for sp3 carbon reported in the literature.\n Hypothesis: The binding energy for sp2-bonded carbon is a topic of significant disagreement in the literature.", "answer": "false", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Physics", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "physics_hypothesis_verification", "source": "Physics Literatures"}}

The analysis of the bonding configuration of carbon is normally carried out by XPS through the acquisition of carbon 1s (C(1s)) spectra. The spectra are often fitted with two distinct features, one assigned to threefold-coordinated (sp2) carbon and one assigned to fourfold-coordinated (sp3) carbon. In spite of the wide use of this analytical procedure for the quantitative evaluation of the carbon hybridization state on the basis of C(1s) XPS signals, the validity of this methodology has recently been questioned and still remains a matter of discussion in the literature. We have recently shown that absolute XPS peak positions can be predicted by facile spin-paired DFT calculations within the frozen core approximation. This is demonstrated by experimental C(1s) binding energies of highly B-doped ultrananocrystalline diamond that are in good agreement to simulations.\n Hypothesis: The analysis of the bonding configuration of carbon using XPS is based on the acquisition of carbon 1s (C(1s)) spectra.", "answer": "true", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Physics", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "physics_hypothesis_verification", "source": "Physics Literatures"}}

The main difficulty in assigning core hole energies, particularly C(1s) energies, is the unambiguous definition of the reference energy. For gas-phase investigations, the energy of an electron in a vacuum far from the mother ion can be used as a well-defined reference for the core electron binding energy EB. For solid samples, the Fermi energy is typically used as the reference energy level, but this energy can only be correctly defined for systems without a band gap, such as metals or semi-metallic systems like graphite. Consequently, the experimental variation in C(1s) energies of semi-metal graphite is moderate and ranges from 284.28 eV to 284.63 eV. Diamond, in contrast, has a very large band gap, which hinders the consistent definition of an energy reference.\n Hypothesis: The main difficulty in assigning core hole energies, particularly C(1s) energies, lies in the accurate definition of the Fermi energy for gas-phase investigations.", "answer": "false", "type": "true_or_false", "domain": "Physics", "details": {"level": "L2", "task": "L2_General", "subtask": "physics_hypothesis_verification", "source": "Physics Literatures"}}

The numerical precision of this approach is illustrated with calculations of the pressure field due to radiating bodies in acoustic wave problems. This method facilitates the use of higher-order surface elements to represent boundaries, resulting in a significant reduction in problem size with improved precision. Problems with extreme geometric aspect ratios can also be handled without diminished precision. When combined with the CHIEF method, the uniqueness of the solution of the exterior acoustic problem is assured without the need to solve hypersingular integrals.

This helps suppress the resonant solution that has no physical significance in the external problem.
